 - **Abstract**
 The 3D visual grounding task has been explored with visual and language streams comprehending referential language to identify target objects in 3D scenes. However, most existing methods devote the visual stream to capturing the 3D visual clues using off-the-shelf point clouds encoders. The main question we address in this paper is "can we consolidate the 3D visual stream by 2D clues synthesized from point clouds and efficiently utilize them in training and testing?". The main idea is to assist the 3D encoder by incorporating rich 2D object representations without requiring extra 2D inputs. To this end, we leverage 2D clues, synthetically generated from 3D point clouds, and empirically show their aptitude to boost the quality of the learned visual representations. We validate our approach through comprehensive experiments on Nr3D, Sr3D, and ScanRefer datasets and show consistent performance gains compared to existing methods. Our proposed module, dubbed as Look Around and Refer (LAR), significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art 3D visual grounding techniques on three benchmarks, i.e., Nr3D, Sr3D, and ScanRefer. The code is available at https://eslambakr.github.io/LAR.github.io/.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper presents an automated driving system (ADS) data acquisition and processing platform for vehicle trajectory extraction, reconstruction, and evaluation based on connected automated vehicle (CAV) cooperative perception. This platform presents a holistic pipeline from the raw advanced sensory data collection to data processing, which can process the sensor data from multiple CAVs and extract the objects' Identity (ID) number, position, speed, and orientation information in the map and Frenet coordinates. First, the ADS data acquisition and analytics platform are presented. Specifically, the experimental CAVs platform and sensor configuration are shown, and the processing software, including a deep-learning-based object detection algorithm using LiDAR information, a late fusion scheme to leverage cooperative perception to fuse the detected objects from multiple CAVs, and a multi-object tracking method is introduced. To further enhance the object detection and tracking results, high definition maps consisting of point cloud and vector maps are generated and forwarded to a world model to filter out the objects off the road and extract the objects' coordinates in Frenet coordinates and the lane information. In addition, a post-processing method is proposed to refine trajectories from the object tracking algorithms. Aiming to tackle the ID switch issue of the object tracking algorithm, a fuzzy-logic-based approach is proposed to detect the discontinuous trajectories of the same object. Finally, results, including object detection and tracking and a late fusion scheme, are presented, and the post-processing algorithm's improvements in noise level and outlier removal are discussed, confirming the functionality and effectiveness of the proposed holistic data collection and processing platform.

 - **Abstract**
 Fusing data from cameras and LiDAR sensors is an essential technique to achieve robust 3D object detection. One key challenge in camera-LiDAR fusion involves mitigating the large domain gap between the two sensors in terms of coordinates and data distribution when fusing their features. In this paper, we propose a novel camera-LiDAR fusion architecture called, 3D Dual-Fusion, which is designed to mitigate the gap between the feature representations of camera and LiDAR data. The proposed method fuses the features of the camera-view and 3D voxel-view domain and models their interactions through deformable attention. We redesign the transformer fusion encoder to aggregate the information from the two domains. Two major changes include 1) dual query-based deformable attention to fuse the dual-domain features interactively and 2) 3D local self-attention to encode the voxel-domain queries prior to dual-query decoding. The results of an experimental evaluation show that the proposed camera-LiDAR fusion architecture achieved competitive performance on the KITTI and nuScenes datasets, with state-of-the-art performances in some 3D object detection benchmarks categories.

 - **Abstract**
 We focus on the task of far-field 3D detection (Far3Det) of objects beyond a certain distance from an observer, e.g., $>$50m. Far3Det is particularly important for autonomous vehicles (AVs) operating at highway speeds, which require detections of far-field obstacles to ensure sufficient braking distances. However, contemporary AV benchmarks such as nuScenes underemphasize this problem because they evaluate performance only up to a certain distance (50m). One reason is that obtaining far-field 3D annotations is difficult, particularly for lidar sensors that produce very few point returns for far-away objects. Indeed, we find that almost 50% of far-field objects (beyond 50m) contain zero lidar points. Secondly, current metrics for 3D detection employ a "one-size-fits-all" philosophy, using the same tolerance thresholds for near and far objects, inconsistent with tolerances for both human vision and stereo disparities. Both factors lead to an incomplete analysis of the Far3Det task. For example, while conventional wisdom tells us that high-resolution RGB sensors should be vital for 3D detection of far-away objects, lidar-based methods still rank higher compared to RGB counterparts on the current benchmark leaderboards. As a first step towards a Far3Det benchmark, we develop a method to find well-annotated scenes from the nuScenes dataset and derive a well-annotated far-field validation set. We also propose a Far3Det evaluation protocol and explore various 3D detection methods for Far3Det. Our result convincingly justifies the long-held conventional wisdom that high-resolution RGB improves 3D detection in the far-field. We further propose a simple yet effective method that fuses detections from RGB and lidar detectors based on non-maximum suppression, which remarkably outperforms state-of-the-art 3D detectors in the far-field.

 - **Abstract**
 Building models that comply with the invariances inherent to different domains, such as invariance under translation or rotation, is a key aspect of applying machine learning to real world problems like molecular property prediction, medical imaging, protein folding or LiDAR classification. For the first time, we study how the invariances of a model can be leveraged to provably guarantee the robustness of its predictions. We propose a gray-box approach, enhancing the powerful black-box randomized smoothing technique with white-box knowledge about invariances. First, we develop gray-box certificates based on group orbits, which can be applied to arbitrary models with invariance under permutation and Euclidean isometries. Then, we derive provably tight gray-box certificates. We experimentally demonstrate that the provably tight certificates can offer much stronger guarantees, but that in practical scenarios the orbit-based method is a good approximation.

 - **Abstract**
 Capitalizing on the recent advances in image generation models, existing controllable face image synthesis methods are able to generate high-fidelity images with some levels of controllability, e.g., controlling the shapes, expressions, textures, and poses of the generated face images. However, previous methods focus on controllable 2D image generative models, which are prone to producing inconsistent face images under large expression and pose changes. In this paper, we propose a new NeRF-based conditional 3D face synthesis framework, which enables 3D controllability over the generated face images by imposing explicit 3D conditions from 3D face priors. At its core is a conditional Generative Occupancy Field (cGOF++) that effectively enforces the shape of the generated face to conform to a given 3D Morphable Model (3DMM) mesh, built on top of EG3D [1], a recent tri-plane-based generative model. To achieve accurate control over fine-grained 3D face shapes of the synthesized images, we additionally incorporate a 3D landmark loss as well as a volume warping loss into our synthesis framework. Experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, which is able to generate high-fidelity face images and shows more precise 3D controllability than state-of-the-art 2D-based controllable face synthesis methods.

 - **Abstract**
 Neural radiance field (NeRF), in particular its extension by instant neural graphics primitives, is a novel rendering method for view synthesis that uses real-world images to build photo-realistic immersive virtual scenes. Despite its potential, research on the combination of NeRF and virtual reality (VR) remains sparse. Currently, there is no integration into typical VR systems available, and the performance and suitability of NeRF implementations for VR have not been evaluated, for instance, for different scene complexities or screen resolutions. In this paper, we present and evaluate a NeRF-based framework that is capable of rendering scenes in immersive VR allowing users to freely move their heads to explore complex real-world scenes. We evaluate our framework by benchmarking three different NeRF scenes concerning their rendering performance at different scene complexities and resolutions. Utilizing super-resolution, our approach can yield a frame rate of 30 frames per second with a resolution of 1280x720 pixels per eye. We discuss potential applications of our framework and provide an open source implementation online.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we propose the first-ever real benchmark thought for evaluating Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) and, in general, Neural Rendering (NR) frameworks. We design and implement an effective pipeline for scanning real objects in quantity and effortlessly. Our scan station is built with less than 500$ hardware budget and can collect roughly 4000 images of a scanned object in just 5 minutes. Such a platform is used to build ScanNeRF, a dataset characterized by several train/val/test splits aimed at benchmarking the performance of modern NeRF methods under different conditions. Accordingly, we evaluate three cutting-edge NeRF variants on it to highlight their strengths and weaknesses. The dataset is available on our project page, together with an online benchmark to foster the development of better and better NeRFs.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent breakthroughs in Vision-Language (V&L) joint research have achieved remarkable results in various text-driven tasks. High-quality Text-to-video (T2V), a task that has been long considered mission-impossible, was proven feasible with reasonably good results in latest works. However, the resulting videos often have undesired artifacts largely because the system is purely data-driven and agnostic to the physical laws. To tackle this issue and further push T2V towards high-level physical realism, we present an autonomous data generation technique and a dataset, which intend to narrow the gap with a large number of multi-modal, 3D Text-to-Video/Simulation (T2V/S) data. In the dataset, we provide high-resolution 3D physical simulations for both solids and fluids, along with textual descriptions of the physical phenomena. We take advantage of state-of-the-art physical simulation methods (i) Incremental Potential Contact (IPC) and (ii) Material Point Method (MPM) to simulate diverse scenarios, including elastic deformations, material fractures, collisions, turbulence, etc. Additionally, high-quality, multi-view rendering videos are supplied for the benefit of T2V, Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), and other communities. This work is the first step towards fully automated Text-to-Video/Simulation (T2V/S). Live examples and subsequent work are at https://sites.google.com/view/tpa-net.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.13969
 - **Abstract**
 An increasing amount of applications rely on data-driven models that are deployed for perception tasks across a sequence of scenes. Due to the mismatch between training and deployment data, adapting the model on the new scenes is often crucial to obtain good performance. In this work, we study continual multi-scene adaptation for the task of semantic segmentation, assuming that no ground-truth labels are available during deployment and that performance on the previous scenes should be maintained. We propose training a Semantic-NeRF network for each scene by fusing the predictions of a segmentation model and then using the view-consistent rendered semantic labels as pseudo-labels to adapt the model. Through joint training with the segmentation model, the Semantic-NeRF model effectively enables 2D-3D knowledge transfer. Furthermore, due to its compact size, it can be stored in a long-term memory and subsequently used to render data from arbitrary viewpoints to reduce forgetting. We evaluate our approach on ScanNet, where we outperform both a voxel-based baseline and a state-of-the-art unsupervised domain adaptation method.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.13994
 - **Abstract**
 We present Dynamic Neural Portraits, a novel approach to the problem of full-head reenactment. Our method generates photo-realistic video portraits by explicitly controlling head pose, facial expressions and eye gaze. Our proposed architecture is different from existing methods that rely on GAN-based image-to-image translation networks for transforming renderings of 3D faces into photo-realistic images. Instead, we build our system upon a 2D coordinate-based MLP with controllable dynamics. Our intuition to adopt a 2D-based representation, as opposed to recent 3D NeRF-like systems, stems from the fact that video portraits are captured by monocular stationary cameras, therefore, only a single viewpoint of the scene is available. Primarily, we condition our generative model on expression blendshapes, nonetheless, we show that our system can be successfully driven by audio features as well. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed method is 270 times faster than recent NeRF-based reenactment methods, with our networks achieving speeds of 24 fps for resolutions up to 1024 x 1024, while outperforming prior works in terms of visual quality.
### ShadowNeuS: Neural SDF Reconstruction by Shadow Ray Supervision

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14086
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.14086
 - **Abstract**
 By supervising camera rays between a scene and multi-view image planes, NeRF reconstructs a neural scene representation for the task of novel view synthesis. On the other hand, shadow rays between the light source and the scene have yet to be considered. Therefore, we propose a novel shadow ray supervision scheme that optimizes both the samples along the ray and the ray location. By supervising shadow rays, we successfully reconstruct a neural SDF of the scene from single-view pure shadow or RGB images under multiple lighting conditions. Given single-view binary shadows, we train a neural network to reconstruct a complete scene not limited by the camera's line of sight. By further modeling the correlation between the image colors and the shadow rays, our technique can also be effectively extended to RGB inputs. We compare our method with previous works on challenging tasks of shape reconstruction from single-view binary shadow or RGB images and observe significant improvements. The code and data will be released.

 - **Abstract**
 Text-guided diffusion models have shown superior performance in image/video generation and editing. While few explorations have been performed in 3D scenarios. In this paper, we discuss three fundamental and interesting problems on this topic. First, we equip text-guided diffusion models to achieve \textbf{3D-consistent generation}. Specifically, we integrate a NeRF-like neural field to generate low-resolution coarse results for a given camera view. Such results can provide 3D priors as condition information for the following diffusion process. During denoising diffusion, we further enhance the 3D consistency by modeling cross-view correspondences with a novel two-stream (corresponding to two different views) asynchronous diffusion process. Second, we study \textbf{3D local editing} and propose a two-step solution that can generate 360$^{\circ}$ manipulated results by editing an object from a single view. Step 1, we propose to perform 2D local editing by blending the predicted noises. Step 2, we conduct a noise-to-text inversion process that maps 2D blended noises into the view-independent text embedding space. Once the corresponding text embedding is obtained, 360$^{\circ}$ images can be generated. Last but not least, we extend our model to perform \textbf{one-shot novel view synthesis} by fine-tuning on a single image, firstly showing the potential of leveraging text guidance for novel view synthesis. Extensive experiments and various applications show the prowess of our 3DDesigner. Project page is available at \url{https://3ddesigner-diffusion.github.io/}.

### Towards Practical Control of Singular Values of Convolutional Layers

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.13771
 - **Abstract**
 In general, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are easy to train, but their essential properties, such as generalization error and adversarial robustness, are hard to control. Recent research demonstrated that singular values of convolutional layers significantly affect such elusive properties and offered several methods for controlling them. Nevertheless, these methods present an intractable computational challenge or resort to coarse approximations. In this paper, we offer a principled approach to alleviating constraints of the prior art at the expense of an insignificant reduction in layer expressivity. Our method is based on the tensor-train decomposition; it retains control over the actual singular values of convolutional mappings while providing structurally sparse and hardware-friendly representation. We demonstrate the improved properties of modern CNNs with our method and analyze its impact on the model performance, calibration, and adversarial robustness.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.13810
 - **Abstract**
 Long-term data-driven studies have become indispensable in many areas of science. Often, the data formats, structures and semantics of data change over time, the data sets evolve. Therefore, studies over several decades in particular have to consider changing database schemas. The evolution of these databases lead at some point to a large number of schemas, which have to be stored and managed, costly and time-consuming. However, in the sense of reproducibility of research data each database version must be reconstructable with little effort. So a previously published result can be validated and reproduced at any time. Nevertheless, in many cases, such an evolution can not be fully reconstructed. This article classifies the 15 most frequently used schema modification operators and defines the associated inverses for each operation. For avoiding an information loss, it furthermore defines which additional provenance information have to be stored. We define four classes dealing with dangling tuples, duplicates and provenance-invariant operators. Each class will be presented by one representative. By using and extending the theory of schema mappings and their inverses for queries, data analysis, why-provenance, and schema evolution, we are able to combine data analysis applications with provenance under evolving database structures, in order to enable the reproducibility of scientific results over longer periods of time. While most of the inverses of schema mappings used for analysis or evolution are not exact, but only quasi-inverses, adding provenance information enables us to reconstruct a sub-database of research data that is sufficient to guarantee reproducibility.

 - **Abstract**
 Context: Although software development is a human activity, Software Engineering (SE) research has focused mostly on processes and tools, making human factors underrepresented. This kind of research may be improved using knowledge from human-focused disciplines. An example of missed opportunities is how SE employs psychometric instruments. Objective: Provide an overview of psychometric instruments in SE research regarding personality and provide recommendations on when adopting them. Method: We conducted a systematic mapping to build a catalog of instruments used within SE for assessing personality and reviewed their use from a multidisciplinary perspective of SE and social science. Results: We contribute with an update of a secondary study covering fifty years of research (1970 to 2020). We observed remaining discrepancies between one of the most adopted instruments (MBTI) and existing recommendations in the literature. We also emphasize that several instruments refer to the Five-Factor Model, and specific advice on how to apply this model within the SE domain is still missing. Conclusion: The findings show that the adoption of psychometric instruments regarding personality in SE needs to be improved, ideally with the support of social sciences researchers. We believe that the review presented in this study can help to understand limitations and evolve in this direction.

 - **Abstract**
 True-time-delay (TTD) lines are recently applied inside Terahertz (THz) hybrid-precoding transceiver to acquire high beamforming gain against beam squint effect. However, beam tracking turns into a challenging puzzle where enormous potential beam directions bring about unacceptable overhead consumption. Frequency-scanning-based beam tracking is initially explored but still imperfect in previous studies. In this paper, based on TTD-aided hybrid precoding structure, we give an enhanced frequency-scanning-based tracking scheme. Multiple beams are generated and utilized simultaneously via several subcarriers for tracking at one timeslot. The squint beams' angular coverage at all subcarriers can be flexibly controlled by two different subcarrier-angular mapping policies, named forward-pairing and backward-pairing. Then multiple physical directions can be simultaneously searched in one timeslot for lower overhead consumption. Besides, closed-form searching radius bound, parameter configuration and interferences are theoretically analyzed. Furthermore, we provide the coupled codebook design for TTDs and phase shifters (PSs), with joint consideration of both beamforming and tracking. Analytical and numerical results demonstrate the superiority of the new frequency-scanning-based tracking scheme and beamforming codebook.

 - **Abstract**
 Long-term autonomy is one of the most demanded capabilities looked into a robot. The possibility to perform the same task over and over on a long temporal horizon, offering a high standard of reproducibility and robustness, is appealing. Long-term autonomy can play a crucial role in the adoption of robotics systems for precision agriculture, for example in assisting humans in monitoring and harvesting crops in a large orchard. With this scope in mind, we report an ongoing effort in the long-term deployment of an autonomous mobile robot in a vineyard for data collection across multiple months. The main aim is to collect data from the same area at different points in time so to be able to analyse the impact of the environmental changes in the mapping and localisation tasks. In this work, we present a map-based localisation study taking 4 data sessions. We identify expected failures when the pre-built map visually differs from the environment's current appearance and we anticipate LTS-Net, a solution pointed at extracting stable temporal features for improving long-term 4D localisation results.

 - **Abstract**
 Complete computation of turbulent combustion flow involves two separate steps: mapping reaction kinetics to low-dimensional manifolds and looking-up this approximate manifold during CFD run-time to estimate the thermo-chemical state variables. In our previous work, we showed that using a deep architecture to learn the two steps jointly, instead of separately, is 73% more accurate at estimating the source energy, a key state variable, compared to benchmarks and can be integrated within a DNS turbulent combustion framework. In their natural form, such deep architectures do not allow for uncertainty quantification of the quantities of interest: the source energy and key species source terms. In this paper, we expand on such architectures, specifically ChemTab, by introducing deep ensembles to approximate the posterior distribution of the quantities of interest. We investigate two strategies of creating these ensemble models: one that keeps the flamelet origin information (Flamelets strategy) and one that ignores the origin and considers all the data independently (Points strategy). To train these models we used flamelet data generated by the GRI--Mech 3.0 methane mechanism, which consists of 53 chemical species and 325 reactions. Our results demonstrate that the Flamelets strategy is superior in terms of the absolute prediction error for the quantities of interest, but is reliant on the types of flamelets used to train the ensemble. The Points strategy is best at capturing the variability of the quantities of interest, independent of the flamelet types. We conclude that, overall, ChemTab Deep Ensembles allows for a more accurate representation of the source energy and key species source terms, compared to the model without these modifications.

 - **Abstract**
 We provide time- and sample-efficient algorithms for learning and testing latent-tree Ising models, i.e. Ising models that may only be observed at their leaf nodes. On the learning side, we obtain efficient algorithms for learning a tree-structured Ising model whose leaf node distribution is close in Total Variation Distance, improving on the results of prior work. On the testing side, we provide an efficient algorithm with fewer samples for testing whether two latent-tree Ising models have leaf-node distributions that are close or far in Total Variation distance. We obtain our algorithms by showing novel localization results for the total variation distance between the leaf-node distributions of tree-structured Ising models, in terms of their marginals on pairs of leaves.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper presents a general one-shot object localization algorithm called OneLoc. Current one-shot object localization or detection methods either rely on a slow exhaustive feature matching process or lack the ability to generalize to novel objects. In contrast, our proposed OneLoc algorithm efficiently finds the object center and bounding box size by a special voting scheme. To keep our method scale-invariant, only unit center offset directions and relative sizes are estimated. A novel dense equalized voting module is proposed to better locate small texture-less objects. Experiments show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art overall performance on two datasets: OnePose dataset and LINEMOD dataset. In addition, our method can also achieve one-shot multi-instance detection and non-rigid object localization. Code repository: https://github.com/qq456cvb/OneLoc.

 - **Abstract**
 Visuotactile sensing technology is becoming more popular in tactile sensing, but the effectiveness of the existing marker detection localization methods remains to be further explored. Instead of contour-based blob detection, this paper presents a learning-based marker localization network for GelStereo visuotactile sensing called Marknet. Specifically, the Marknet presents a grid regression architecture to incorporate the distribution of the GelStereo markers. Furthermore, a marker rationality evaluator (MRE) is modelled to screen suitable prediction results. The experimental results show that the Marknet combined with MRE achieves 93.90% precision for irregular markers in contact areas, which outperforms the traditional contour-based blob detection method by a large margin of 42.32%. Meanwhile, the proposed learning-based marker localization method can achieve better real-time performance beyond the blob detection interface provided by the OpenCV library through GPU acceleration, which we believe will lead to considerable perceptual sensitivity gains in various robotic manipulation tasks.

 - **Abstract**
 We aim to learn to temporally localize object state changes and the corresponding state-modifying actions by observing people interacting with objects in long uncurated web videos. We introduce three principal contributions. First, we explore alternative multi-task network architectures and identify a model that enables efficient joint learning of multiple object states and actions such as pouring water and pouring coffee. Second, we design a multi-task self-supervised learning procedure that exploits different types of constraints between objects and state-modifying actions enabling end-to-end training of a model for temporal localization of object states and actions in videos from only noisy video-level supervision. Third, we report results on the large-scale ChangeIt and COIN datasets containing tens of thousands of long (un)curated web videos depicting various interactions such as hole drilling, cream whisking, or paper plane folding. We show that our multi-task model achieves a relative improvement of 40% over the prior single-task methods and significantly outperforms both image-based and video-based zero-shot models for this problem. We also test our method on long egocentric videos of the EPIC-KITCHENS and the Ego4D datasets in a zero-shot setup demonstrating the robustness of our learned model.

 - **Abstract**
 While a large number of recent works on semantic segmentation focus on designing and incorporating a transformer-based encoder, much less attention and vigor have been devoted to transformer-based decoders. For such a task whose hallmark quest is pixel-accurate prediction, we argue that the decoder stage is just as crucial as that of the encoder in achieving superior segmentation performance, by disentangling and refining the high-level cues and working out object boundaries with pixel-level precision. In this paper, we propose a novel transformer-based decoder called UperFormer, which is plug-and-play for hierarchical encoders and attains high quality segmentation results regardless of encoder architecture. UperFormer is equipped with carefully designed multi-head skip attention units and novel upsampling operations. Multi-head skip attention is able to fuse multi-scale features from backbones with those in decoders. The upsampling operation, which incorporates feature from encoder, can be more friendly for object localization. It brings a 0.4% to 3.2% increase compared with traditional upsampling methods. By combining UperFormer with Swin Transformer (Swin-T), a fully transformer-based symmetric network is formed for semantic segmentation tasks. Extensive experiments show that our proposed approach is highly effective and computationally efficient. On Cityscapes dataset, we achieve state-of-the-art performance. On the more challenging ADE20K dataset, our best model yields a single-scale mIoU of 50.18, and a multi-scale mIoU of 51.8, which is on-par with the current state-of-art model, while we drastically cut the number of FLOPs by 53.5%.

 - **Abstract**
 Temporal action localization (TAL) requires long-form reasoning to predict actions of various lengths and complex content. Given limited GPU memory, training TAL end-to-end on such long-form videos (i.e., from videos to predictions) is a significant challenge. Most methods can only train on pre-extracted features without optimizing them for the localization problem, consequently limiting localization performance. In this work, to extend the potential in TAL networks, we propose a novel end-to-end method Re2TAL, which rewires pretrained video backbones for reversible TAL. Re2TAL builds a backbone with reversible modules, where the input can be recovered from the output such that the bulky intermediate activations can be cleared from memory during training. Instead of designing one single type of reversible module, we propose a network rewiring mechanism, to transform any module with a residual connection to a reversible module without changing any parameters. This provides two benefits: (1) a large variety of reversible networks are easily obtained from existing and even future model designs, and (2) the reversible models require much less training effort as they reuse the pre-trained parameters of their original non-reversible versions. Re2TAL reaches 37.01% average mAP, a new state-of-the-art record on ActivityNet-v1.3, and mAP 64.9% at tIoU=0.5 on THUMOS-14 without using optimal flow.

 - **Abstract**
 Accurate 6D object pose estimation is an important task for a variety of robotic applications such as grasping or localization. It is a challenging task due to object symmetries, clutter and occlusion, but it becomes more challenging when additional information, such as depth and 3D models, is not provided. We present a transformer-based approach that takes an RGB image as input and predicts a 6D pose for each object in the image. Besides the image, our network does not require any additional information such as depth maps or 3D object models. First, the image is passed through an object detector to generate feature maps and to detect objects. Then, the feature maps are fed into a transformer with the detected bounding boxes as additional information. Afterwards, the output object queries are processed by a separate translation and rotation head. We achieve state-of-the-art results for RGB-only approaches on the challenging YCB-V dataset. We illustrate the suitability of the resulting model as pose sensor for a 6-DoF state estimation task. Code is available at https://github.com/aau-cns/poet.

 - **Abstract**
 GPS trajectories are the essential foundations for many trajectory-based applications, such as travel time estimation, traffic prediction and trajectory similarity measurement. Most applications require a large amount of high sample rate trajectories to achieve a good performance. However, many real-life trajectories are collected with low sample rate due to energy concern or other constraints.We study the task of trajectory recovery in this paper as a means for increasing the sample rate of low sample trajectories. Currently, most existing works on trajectory recovery follow a sequence-to-sequence diagram, with an encoder to encode a trajectory and a decoder to recover real GPS points in the trajectory. However, these works ignore the topology of road network and only use grid information or raw GPS points as input. Therefore, the encoder model is not able to capture rich spatial information of the GPS points along the trajectory, making the prediction less accurate and lack spatial consistency. In this paper, we propose a road network enhanced transformer-based framework, namely RNTrajRec, for trajectory recovery. RNTrajRec first uses a graph model, namely GridGNN, to learn the embedding features of each road segment. It next develops a Sub-Graph Generation module to represent each GPS point as a sub-graph structure of the road network around the GPS point. It then introduces a spatial-temporal transformer model, namely GPSFormer, to learn rich spatial and temporal features. It finally forwards the outputs of encoder model into a multi-task decoder model to recover the missing GPS points. Extensive experiments based on three large-scale real-life trajectory datasets confirm the effectiveness of our approach.

 - **Abstract**
 The paper presents a novel approach for vector-floorplan generation via a diffusion model, which denoises 2D coordinates of room/door corners with two inference objectives: 1) a single-step noise as the continuous quantity to precisely invert the continuous forward process; and 2) the final 2D coordinate as the discrete quantity to establish geometric incident relationships such as parallelism, orthogonality, and corner-sharing. Our task is graph-conditioned floorplan generation, a common workflow in floorplan design. We represent a floorplan as 1D polygonal loops, each of which corresponds to a room or a door. Our diffusion model employs a Transformer architecture at the core, which controls the attention masks based on the input graph-constraint and directly generates vector-graphics floorplans via a discrete and continuous denoising process. We have evaluated our approach on RPLAN dataset. The proposed approach makes significant improvements in all the metrics against the state-of-the-art with significant margins, while being capable of generating non-Manhattan structures and controlling the exact number of corners per room.

 - **Abstract**
 Large sequence to sequence models for tasks such as Neural Machine Translation (NMT) are usually trained over hundreds of millions of samples. However, training is just the origin of a model's life-cycle. Real-world deployments of models require further behavioral adaptations as new requirements emerge or shortcomings become known. Typically, in the space of model behaviors, behavior deletion requests are addressed through model retrainings whereas model finetuning is done to address behavior addition requests, both procedures being instances of data-based model intervention. In this work, we present a preliminary study investigating rank-one editing as a direct intervention method for behavior deletion requests in encoder-decoder transformer models. We propose four editing tasks for NMT and show that the proposed editing algorithm achieves high efficacy, while requiring only a single instance of positive example to fix an erroneous (negative) model behavior.

 - **Abstract**
 We present Mesh Pre-Training (MPT), a new pre-training framework that leverages 3D mesh data such as MoCap data for human pose and mesh reconstruction from a single image. Existing work in 3D pose and mesh reconstruction typically requires image-mesh pairs as the training data, but the acquisition of 2D-to-3D annotations is difficult. In this paper, we explore how to leverage 3D mesh data such as MoCap data, that does not have RGB images, for pre-training. The key idea is that even though 3D mesh data cannot be used for end-to-end training due to a lack of the corresponding RGB images, it can be used to pre-train the mesh regression transformer subnetwork. We observe that such pre-training not only improves the accuracy of mesh reconstruction from a single image, but also enables zero-shot capability. We conduct mesh pre-training using 2 million meshes. Experimental results show that MPT advances the state-of-the-art results on Human3.6M and 3DPW datasets. We also show that MPT enables transformer models to have zero-shot capability of human mesh reconstruction from real images. In addition, we demonstrate the generalizability of MPT to 3D hand reconstruction, achieving state-of-the-art results on FreiHAND dataset.

 - **Abstract**
 Chest X-ray is one of the most popular medical imaging modalities due to its accessibility and effectiveness. However, there is a chronic shortage of well-trained radiologists who can interpret these images and diagnose the patient's condition. Therefore, automated radiology report generation can be a very helpful tool in clinical practice. A typical report generation workflow consists of two main steps: (i) encoding the image into a latent space and (ii) generating the text of the report based on the latent image embedding. Many existing report generation techniques use a standard convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture for image encoding followed by a Transformer-based decoder for medical text generation. In most cases, CNN and the decoder are trained jointly in an end-to-end fashion. In this work, we primarily focus on understanding the relative importance of encoder and decoder components. Towards this end, we analyze four different image encoding approaches: direct, fine-grained, CLIP-based, and Cluster-CLIP-based encodings in conjunction with three different decoders on the large-scale MIMIC-CXR dataset. Among these encoders, the cluster CLIP visual encoder is a novel approach that aims to generate more discriminative and explainable representations. CLIP-based encoders produce comparable results to traditional CNN-based encoders in terms of NLP metrics, while fine-grained encoding outperforms all other encoders both in terms of NLP and clinical accuracy metrics, thereby validating the importance of image encoder to effectively extract semantic information.

 - **Abstract**
 Complex query answering (CQA) is an essential task for multi-hop and logical reasoning on knowledge graphs (KGs). Currently, most approaches are limited to queries among binary relational facts and pay less attention to n-ary facts (n>=2) containing more than two entities, which are more prevalent in the real world. Moreover, previous CQA methods can only make predictions for a few given types of queries and cannot be flexibly extended to more complex logical queries, which significantly limits their applications. To overcome these challenges, in this work, we propose a novel N-ary Query Embedding (NQE) model for CQA over hyper-relational knowledge graphs (HKGs), which include massive n-ary facts. The NQE utilizes a dual-heterogeneous Transformer encoder and fuzzy logic theory to satisfy all n-ary FOL queries, including existential quantifiers, conjunction, disjunction, and negation. We also propose a parallel processing algorithm that can train or predict arbitrary n-ary FOL queries in a single batch, regardless of the kind of each query, with good flexibility and extensibility. In addition, we generate a new CQA dataset WD50K-NFOL, including diverse n-ary FOL queries over WD50K. Experimental results on WD50K-NFOL and other standard CQA datasets show that NQE is the state-of-the-art CQA method over HKGs with good generalization capability. Our code and dataset are publicly available.

 - **Abstract**
 Visual search is a ubiquitous challenge in natural vision, including daily tasks such as finding a friend in a crowd or searching for a car in a parking lot. Human rely heavily on relevant target features to perform goal-directed visual search. Meanwhile, context is of critical importance for locating a target object in complex scenes as it helps narrow down the search area and makes the search process more efficient. However, few works have combined both target and context information in visual search computational models. Here we propose a zero-shot deep learning architecture, TCT (Target and Context-aware Transformer), that modulates self attention in the Vision Transformer with target and contextual relevant information to enable human-like zero-shot visual search performance. Target modulation is computed as patch-wise local relevance between the target and search images, whereas contextual modulation is applied in a global fashion. We conduct visual search experiments on TCT and other competitive visual search models on three natural scene datasets with varying levels of difficulty. TCT demonstrates human-like performance in terms of search efficiency and beats the SOTA models in challenging visual search tasks. Importantly, TCT generalizes well across datasets with novel objects without retraining or fine-tuning. Furthermore, we also introduce a new dataset to benchmark models for invariant visual search under incongruent contexts. TCT manages to search flexibly via target and context modulation, even under incongruent contexts.

 - **Abstract**
 Deep learning methods have boosted the adoption of NLP systems in real-life applications. However, they turn out to be vulnerable to distribution shifts over time which may cause severe dysfunctions in production systems, urging practitioners to develop tools to detect out-of-distribution (OOD) samples through the lens of the neural network. In this paper, we introduce TRUSTED, a new OOD detector for classifiers based on Transformer architectures that meets operational requirements: it is unsupervised and fast to compute. The efficiency of TRUSTED relies on the fruitful idea that all hidden layers carry relevant information to detect OOD examples. Based on this, for a given input, TRUSTED consists in (i) aggregating this information and (ii) computing a similarity score by exploiting the training distribution, leveraging the powerful concept of data depth. Our extensive numerical experiments involve 51k model configurations, including various checkpoints, seeds, and datasets, and demonstrate that TRUSTED achieves state-of-the-art performances. In particular, it improves previous AUROC over 3 points.

 - **Abstract**
 Fusing data from cameras and LiDAR sensors is an essential technique to achieve robust 3D object detection. One key challenge in camera-LiDAR fusion involves mitigating the large domain gap between the two sensors in terms of coordinates and data distribution when fusing their features. In this paper, we propose a novel camera-LiDAR fusion architecture called, 3D Dual-Fusion, which is designed to mitigate the gap between the feature representations of camera and LiDAR data. The proposed method fuses the features of the camera-view and 3D voxel-view domain and models their interactions through deformable attention. We redesign the transformer fusion encoder to aggregate the information from the two domains. Two major changes include 1) dual query-based deformable attention to fuse the dual-domain features interactively and 2) 3D local self-attention to encode the voxel-domain queries prior to dual-query decoding. The results of an experimental evaluation show that the proposed camera-LiDAR fusion architecture achieved competitive performance on the KITTI and nuScenes datasets, with state-of-the-art performances in some 3D object detection benchmarks categories.

 - **Abstract**
 Facial expression recognition (FER) plays a significant role in the ubiquitous application of computer vision. We revisit this problem with a new perspective on whether it can acquire useful representations that improve FER performance in the image generation process, and propose a novel generative method based on the image inversion mechanism for the FER task, termed Inversion FER (IFER). Particularly, we devise a novel Adversarial Style Inversion Transformer (ASIT) towards IFER to comprehensively extract features of generated facial images. In addition, ASIT is equipped with an image inversion discriminator that measures the cosine similarity of semantic features between source and generated images, constrained by a distribution alignment loss. Finally, we introduce a feature modulation module to fuse the structural code and latent codes from ASIT for the subsequent FER work. We extensively evaluate ASIT on facial datasets such as FFHQ and CelebA-HQ, showing that our approach achieves state-of-the-art facial inversion performance. IFER also achieves competitive results in facial expression recognition datasets such as RAF-DB, SFEW and AffectNet. The code and models are available at https://github.com/Talented-Q/IFER-master.

 - **Abstract**
 Translating spoken languages into Sign languages is necessary for open communication between the hearing and hearing-impaired communities. To achieve this goal, we propose the first method for animating a text written in HamNoSys, a lexical Sign language notation, into signed pose sequences. As HamNoSys is universal, our proposed method offers a generic solution invariant to the target Sign language. Our method gradually generates pose predictions using transformer encoders that create meaningful representations of the text and poses while considering their spatial and temporal information. We use weak supervision for the training process and show that our method succeeds in learning from partial and inaccurate data. Additionally, we offer a new distance measurement for pose sequences, normalized Dynamic Time Warping (nDTW), based on DTW over normalized keypoints trajectories, and validate its correctness using AUTSL, a large-scale Sign language dataset. We show that it measures the distance between pose sequences more accurately than existing measurements and use it to assess the quality of our generated pose sequences. Code for the data pre-processing, the model, and the distance measurement is publicly released for future research.
### Cross Aggregation Transformer for Image Restoration

 - **Abstract**
 Recently, Transformer architecture has been introduced into image restoration to replace convolution neural network (CNN) with surprising results. Considering the high computational complexity of Transformer with global attention, some methods use the local square window to limit the scope of self-attention. However, these methods lack direct interaction among different windows, which limits the establishment of long-range dependencies. To address the above issue, we propose a new image restoration model, Cross Aggregation Transformer (CAT). The core of our CAT is the Rectangle-Window Self-Attention (Rwin-SA), which utilizes horizontal and vertical rectangle window attention in different heads parallelly to expand the attention area and aggregate the features cross different windows. We also introduce the Axial-Shift operation for different window interactions. Furthermore, we propose the Locality Complementary Module to complement the self-attention mechanism, which incorporates the inductive bias of CNN (e.g., translation invariance and locality) into Transformer, enabling global-local coupling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our CAT outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods on several image restoration applications. The code and models are available at https://github.com/zhengchen1999/CAT.

 - **Abstract**
 Object trackers deployed on low-power devices need to be light-weight, however, most of the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods rely on using compute-heavy backbones built using CNNs or transformers. Large sizes of such models do not allow their deployment in low-power conditions and designing compressed variants of large tracking models is of great importance. This paper demonstrates how highly compressed light-weight object trackers can be designed using neural architectural pruning of large CNN and transformer based trackers. Further, a comparative study on architectural choices best suited to design light-weight trackers is provided. A comparison between SOTA trackers using CNNs, transformers as well as the combination of the two is presented to study their stability at various compression ratios. Finally results for extreme pruning scenarios going as low as 1% in some cases are shown to study the limits of network pruning in object tracking. This work provides deeper insights into designing highly efficient trackers from existing SOTA methods.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent advances in the field of language modeling have improved the state-of-the-art in question answering (QA) and question generation (QG). However, the development of modern neural models, their benchmarks, and datasets for training them has mainly focused on English. Finnish, like many other languages, faces a shortage of large QA/QG model training resources, which has prevented experimenting with state-of-the-art QA/QG fine-tuning methods. We present the first neural QA and QG models that work with Finnish. To train the models, we automatically translate the SQuAD dataset and then use normalization methods to reduce the amount of problematic data created during the translation. Using the synthetic data, together with the Finnish partition of the TyDi-QA dataset, we fine-tune several transformer-based models to both QA and QG and evaluate their performance. To the best of our knowledge, the resulting dataset is the first large-scale QA/QG resource for Finnish. This paper also sets the initial benchmarks for Finnish-language QA and QG.

 - **Abstract**
 Although transformer networks are recently employed in various vision tasks with outperforming performance, extensive training data and a lengthy training time are required to train a model to disregard an inductive bias. Using trainable links between the channel-wise spatial attention of a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and the attention head of Vision Transformers (ViT), we present a regularization technique to improve the training efficiency of ViT. The trainable links are referred to as the attention augmentation module, which is trained simultaneously with ViT, boosting the training of ViT and allowing it to avoid the overfitting issue caused by a lack of data. From the trained attention augmentation module, we can extract the relevant relationship between each CNN activation map and each ViT attention head, and based on this, we also propose an advanced attention augmentation module. Consequently, even with a small amount of data, the suggested method considerably improves the performance of ViT while achieving faster convergence during training.

 - **Abstract**
 Transformer models have achieved state-of-the-art performance on various domains of applications and gradually becomes the foundations of the advanced large deep learning (DL) models. However, how to train these models over multiple GPUs efficiently is still challenging due to a large number of parallelism choices. Existing DL systems either rely on manual efforts to make distributed training plans or apply parallelism combinations within a very limited search space. In this approach, we propose Galvatron, a new system framework that incorporates multiple popular parallelism dimensions and automatically finds the most efficient hybrid parallelism strategy. To better explore such a rarely huge search space, we 1) involve a decision tree to make decomposition and pruning based on some reasonable intuitions, and then 2) design a dynamic programming search algorithm to generate the optimal plan. Evaluations on four representative Transformer workloads show that Galvatron could perform automatically distributed training with different GPU memory budgets. Among all evluated scenarios, Galvatron always achieves superior system throughput compared to previous work with limited parallelism.

 The use of vision transformers (ViT) in computer vision is increasing due to limited inductive biases (e.g., locality, weight sharing, etc.) and increased scalability compared to other deep learning methods (e.g., convolutional neural networks (CNN)). This has led to some initial studies on the use of ViT for biometric recognition, including fingerprint recognition. In this work, we improve on these initial studies for transformers in fingerprint recognition by i.) evaluating additional attention-based architectures in addition to vanilla ViT, ii.) scaling to larger and more diverse training and evaluation datasets, and iii.) combining the complimentary representations of attention-based and CNN-based embeddings for improved state-of-the-art (SOTA) fingerprint recognition for both authentication (1:1 comparisons) and identification (1:N comparisions). Our combined architecture, AFR-Net (Attention-Driven Fingerprint Recognition Network), outperforms several baseline transformer and CNN-based models, including a SOTA commercial fingerprint system, Verifinger v12.3, across many intra-sensor, cross-sensor (including contact to contactless), and latent to rolled fingerprint matching datasets. Additionally, we propose a realignment strategy using local embeddings extracted from intermediate feature maps within the networks to refine the global embeddings in low certainty situations, which boosts the overall recognition accuracy significantly for all the evaluations across each of the models. This realignment strategy requires no additional training and can be applied as a wrapper to any existing deep learning network (including attention-based, CNN-based, or both) to boost its performance.

 Unsupervised Machine Learning techniques have been applied to Natural Language Processing tasks and surpasses the benchmarks such as GLUE with great success. Building language models approach achieves good results in one language and it can be applied to multiple NLP task such as classification, summarization, generation and etc as an out of box model. Among all the of the classical approaches used in NLP, the masked language modeling is the most used. In general, the only requirement to build a language model is presence of the large corpus of textual data. Text classification engines uses a variety of models from classical and state of art transformer models to classify texts for in order to save costs. Sequence Classifiers are mostly used in the domain of text classification. However Token classifiers also are viable candidate models as well. Sequence Classifiers and Token Classifier both tend to improve the classification predictions due to the capturing the context information differently. This work aims to compare the performance of Sequence Classifier and Token Classifiers and evaluate each model on the same set of data. In this work, we are using a pre-trained model as the base model and Token Classifier and Sequence Classier heads results of these two scoring paradigms with be compared..

 - **Abstract**
 In this article, we propose using deep learning and transformer architectures combined with classical machine learning algorithms to detect and identify text anomalies in texts. Deep learning model provides a very crucial context information about the textual data which all textual context are converted to a numerical representation. We used multiple machine learning methods such as Sentence Transformers, Auto Encoders, Logistic Regression and Distance calculation methods to predict anomalies. The method are tested on the texts data and we used syntactic data from different source injected into the original text as anomalies or use them as target. Different methods and algorithm are explained in the field of outlier detection and the results of the best technique is presented. These results suggest that our algorithm could potentially reduce false positive rates compared with other anomaly detection methods that we are testing.

 - **Abstract**
 The orthogonality constraints, including the hard and soft ones, have been used to normalize the weight matrices of Deep Neural Network (DNN) models, especially the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Vision Transformer (ViT), to reduce model parameter redundancy and improve training stability. However, the robustness to noisy data of these models with constraints is not always satisfactory. In this work, we propose a novel two-stage approximately orthogonal training framework (TAOTF) to find a trade-off between the orthogonal solution space and the main task solution space to solve this problem in noisy data scenarios. In the first stage, we propose a novel algorithm called polar decomposition-based orthogonal initialization (PDOI) to find a good initialization for the orthogonal optimization. In the second stage, unlike other existing methods, we apply soft orthogonal constraints for all layers of DNN model. We evaluate the proposed model-agnostic framework both on the natural image and medical image datasets, which show that our method achieves stable and superior performances to existing methods.

 - **Abstract**
 Standard multi-modal models assume the use of the same modalities in training and inference stages. However, in practice, the environment in which multi-modal models operate may not satisfy such assumption. As such, their performances degrade drastically if any modality is missing in the inference stage. We ask: how can we train a model that is robust to missing modalities? This paper seeks a set of good practices for multi-modal action recognition, with a particular interest in circumstances where some modalities are not available at an inference time. First, we study how to effectively regularize the model during training (e.g., data augmentation). Second, we investigate on fusion methods for robustness to missing modalities: we find that transformer-based fusion shows better robustness for missing modality than summation or concatenation. Third, we propose a simple modular network, ActionMAE, which learns missing modality predictive coding by randomly dropping modality features and tries to reconstruct them with the remaining modality features. Coupling these good practices, we build a model that is not only effective in multi-modal action recognition but also robust to modality missing. Our model achieves the state-of-the-arts on multiple benchmarks and maintains competitive performances even in missing modality scenarios.

 - **Abstract**
 Previous studies show the necessity of global and local adjustment for image enhancement. However, existing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformer-based models face great challenges in balancing the computational efficiency and effectiveness of global-local information usage. Especially, existing methods typically adopt the global-to-local fusion mode, ignoring the importance of bidirectional interactions. To address those issues, we propose a novel mutual guidance network (MGN) to perform effective bidirectional global-local information exchange while keeping a compact architecture. In our design, we adopt a two-branch framework where one branch focuses more on modeling global relations while the other is committed to processing local information. Then, we develop an efficient attention-based mutual guidance approach throughout our framework for bidirectional global-local interactions. As a result, both the global and local branches can enjoy the merits of mutual information aggregation. Besides, to further refine the results produced by our MGN, we propose a novel residual integration scheme following the divide-and-conquer philosophy. The extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on several public image enhancement benchmarks.

 - **Abstract**
 While a large number of recent works on semantic segmentation focus on designing and incorporating a transformer-based encoder, much less attention and vigor have been devoted to transformer-based decoders. For such a task whose hallmark quest is pixel-accurate prediction, we argue that the decoder stage is just as crucial as that of the encoder in achieving superior segmentation performance, by disentangling and refining the high-level cues and working out object boundaries with pixel-level precision. In this paper, we propose a novel transformer-based decoder called UperFormer, which is plug-and-play for hierarchical encoders and attains high quality segmentation results regardless of encoder architecture. UperFormer is equipped with carefully designed multi-head skip attention units and novel upsampling operations. Multi-head skip attention is able to fuse multi-scale features from backbones with those in decoders. The upsampling operation, which incorporates feature from encoder, can be more friendly for object localization. It brings a 0.4% to 3.2% increase compared with traditional upsampling methods. By combining UperFormer with Swin Transformer (Swin-T), a fully transformer-based symmetric network is formed for semantic segmentation tasks. Extensive experiments show that our proposed approach is highly effective and computationally efficient. On Cityscapes dataset, we achieve state-of-the-art performance. On the more challenging ADE20K dataset, our best model yields a single-scale mIoU of 50.18, and a multi-scale mIoU of 51.8, which is on-par with the current state-of-art model, while we drastically cut the number of FLOPs by 53.5%.

 - **Abstract**
 Reasoning about actions and change (RAC) is essential to understand and interact with the ever-changing environment. Previous AI research has shown the importance of fundamental and indispensable knowledge of actions, i.e., preconditions and effects. However, traditional methods rely on logical formalization which hinders practical applications. With recent transformer-based language models (LMs), reasoning over text is desirable and seemingly feasible, leading to the question of whether LMs can effectively and efficiently learn to solve RAC problems. We propose four essential RAC tasks as a comprehensive textual benchmark and generate problems in a way that minimizes the influence of other linguistic requirements (e.g., grounding) to focus on RAC. The resulting benchmark, TRAC, encompassing problems of various complexities, facilitates a more granular evaluation of LMs, precisely targeting the structural generalization ability much needed for RAC. Experiments with three high-performing transformers indicates that additional efforts are needed to tackle challenges raised by TRAC.

 - **Abstract**
 Triggered by the success of transformers in various visual tasks, the spatial self-attention mechanism has recently attracted more and more attention in the computer vision community. However, we empirically found that a typical vision transformer with the spatial self-attention mechanism could not learn accurate attention maps for distinguishing different categories of fine-grained images. To address this problem, motivated by the temporal attention mechanism in brains, we propose a spatial-temporal attention network for learning fine-grained feature representations, called STAN, where the features learnt by implementing a sequence of spatial self-attention operations corresponding to multiple moments are aggregated progressively. The proposed STAN consists of four modules: a self-attention backbone module for learning a sequence of features with self-attention operations, a spatial feature self-organizing module for facilitating the model training, a spatial-temporal feature learning module for aggregating the re-organized features via a Long Short-Term Memory network, and a context-aware module that is implemented as the forget block of the spatial-temporal feature learning module for preserving/forgetting the long-term memory by utilizing contextual information. Then, we propose a STAN-based method for open-set fine-grained recognition by integrating the proposed STAN network with a linear classifier, called STAN-OSFGR. Extensive experimental results on 3 fine-grained datasets and 2 coarse-grained datasets demonstrate that the proposed STAN-OSFGR outperforms 9 state-of-the-art open-set recognition methods significantly in most cases.

 - **Abstract**
 Secure multi-party computation (MPC) enables computation directly on encrypted data on non-colluding untrusted servers and protects both data and model privacy in deep learning inference. However, existing neural network (NN) architectures, including Vision Transformers (ViTs), are not designed or optimized for MPC protocols and incur significant latency overhead due to the Softmax function in the multi-head attention (MHA). In this paper, we propose an MPC-friendly ViT, dubbed MPCViT, to enable accurate yet efficient ViT inference in MPC. We systematically compare different attention variants in MPC and propose a heterogeneous attention search space, which combines the high-accuracy and MPC-efficient attentions with diverse structure granularities. We further propose a simple yet effective differentiable neural architecture search (NAS) algorithm for fast ViT optimization. MPCViT significantly outperforms prior-art ViT variants in MPC. With the proposed NAS algorithm, our extensive experiments demonstrate that MPCViT achieves 7.9x and 2.8x latency reduction with better accuracy compared to Linformer and MPCFormer on the Tiny-ImageNet dataset, respectively. Further, with proper knowledge distillation (KD), MPCViT even achieves 1.9% better accuracy compared to the baseline ViT with 9.9x latency reduction on the Tiny-ImageNet dataset.

 - **Abstract**
 The success of supervised deep learning methods is largely due to their ability to learn relevant features from raw data. Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) trained on large-scale datasets are capable of capturing a diverse set of features, and learning a representation that can generalize onto unseen tasks and datasets that are from the same domain. Hence, these models can be used as powerful feature extractors, in combination with shallower models as classifiers, for smaller tasks and datasets where the amount of training data is insufficient for learning an end-to-end model from scratch. During the past years, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have largely been the method of choice for audio processing. However, recently attention-based transformer models have demonstrated great potential in supervised settings, outperforming CNNs. In this work, we investigate the use of audio transformers trained on large-scale datasets to learn general-purpose representations. We study how the different setups in these audio transformers affect the quality of their embeddings. We experiment with the models' time resolution, extracted embedding level, and receptive fields in order to see how they affect performance on a variety of tasks and datasets, following the HEAR 2021 NeurIPS challenge evaluation setup. Our results show that representations extracted by audio transformers outperform CNN representations. Furthermore, we will show that transformers trained on Audioset can be extremely effective representation extractors for a wide range of downstream tasks.

 - **Abstract**
 Although substantial efforts have been made using graph neural networks (GNNs) for AI-driven drug discovery (AIDD), effective molecular representation learning remains an open challenge, especially in the case of insufficient labeled molecules. Recent studies suggest that big GNN models pre-trained by self-supervised learning on unlabeled datasets enable better transfer performance in downstream molecular property prediction tasks. However, they often require large-scale datasets and considerable computational resources, which is time-consuming, computationally expensive, and environmentally unfriendly. To alleviate these limitations, we propose a novel pre-training model for molecular representation learning, Bi-branch Masked Graph Transformer Autoencoder (BatmanNet). BatmanNet features two tailored and complementary graph autoencoders to reconstruct the missing nodes and edges from a masked molecular graph. To our surprise, BatmanNet discovered that the highly masked proportion (60%) of the atoms and bonds achieved the best performance. We further propose an asymmetric graph-based encoder-decoder architecture for either nodes and edges, where a transformer-based encoder only takes the visible subset of nodes or edges, and a lightweight decoder reconstructs the original molecule from the latent representation and mask tokens. With this simple yet effective asymmetrical design, our BatmanNet can learn efficiently even from a much smaller-scale unlabeled molecular dataset to capture the underlying structural and semantic information, overcoming a major limitation of current deep neural networks for molecular representation learning. For instance, using only 250K unlabelled molecules as pre-training data, our BatmanNet with 2.575M parameters achieves a 0.5% improvement on the average AUC compared with the current state-of-the-art method with 100M parameters pre-trained on 11M molecules.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper explores the multi-scale aggregation strategy for scene text detection in natural images. We present the Aggregated Text TRansformer(ATTR), which is designed to represent texts in scene images with a multi-scale self-attention mechanism. Starting from the image pyramid with multiple resolutions, the features are first extracted at different scales with shared weight and then fed into an encoder-decoder architecture of Transformer. The multi-scale image representations are robust and contain rich information on text contents of various sizes. The text Transformer aggregates these features to learn the interaction across different scales and improve text representation. The proposed method detects scene texts by representing each text instance as an individual binary mask, which is tolerant of curve texts and regions with dense instances. Extensive experiments on public scene text detection datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

 - **Abstract**
 Continual learning for segmentation has recently seen increasing interest. However, all previous works focus on narrow semantic segmentation and disregard panoptic segmentation, an important task with real-world impacts. %a In this paper, we present the first continual learning model capable of operating on both semantic and panoptic segmentation. Inspired by recent transformer approaches that consider segmentation as a mask-classification problem, we design CoMFormer. Our method carefully exploits the properties of transformer architectures to learn new classes over time. Specifically, we propose a novel adaptive distillation loss along with a mask-based pseudo-labeling technique to effectively prevent forgetting. To evaluate our approach, we introduce a novel continual panoptic segmentation benchmark on the challenging ADE20K dataset. Our CoMFormer outperforms all the existing baselines by forgetting less old classes but also learning more effectively new classes. In addition, we also report an extensive evaluation in the large-scale continual semantic segmentation scenario showing that CoMFormer also significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

 - **Abstract**
 In recent years, artificial intelligence has played an important role on accelerating the whole process of drug discovery. Various of molecular representation schemes of different modals (e.g. textual sequence or graph) are developed. By digitally encoding them, different chemical information can be learned through corresponding network structures. Molecular graphs and Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System (SMILES) are popular means for molecular representation learning in current. Previous works have done attempts by combining both of them to solve the problem of specific information loss in single-modal representation on various tasks. To further fusing such multi-modal imformation, the correspondence between learned chemical feature from different representation should be considered. To realize this, we propose a novel framework of molecular joint representation learning via Multi-Modal information of SMILES and molecular Graphs, called MMSG. We improve the self-attention mechanism by introducing bond level graph representation as attention bias in Transformer to reinforce feature correspondence between multi-modal information. We further propose a Bidirectional Message Communication Graph Neural Network (BMC GNN) to strengthen the information flow aggregated from graphs for further combination. Numerous experiments on public property prediction datasets have demonstrated the effectiveness of our model.

 - **Abstract**
 Hyperspectral image (HSI) denoising is a crucial preprocessing procedure for the subsequent HSI applications. Unfortunately, though witnessing the development of deep learning in HSI denoising area, existing convolution-based methods face the trade-off between computational efficiency and capability to model non-local characteristics of HSI. In this paper, we propose a Spatial-Spectral Transformer (SST) to alleviate this problem. To fully explore intrinsic similarity characteristics in both spatial dimension and spectral dimension, we conduct non-local spatial self-attention and global spectral self-attention with Transformer architecture. The window-based spatial self-attention focuses on the spatial similarity beyond the neighboring region. While, spectral self-attention exploits the long-range dependencies between highly correlative bands. Experimental results show that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art HSI denoising methods in quantitative quality and visual results.

 - **Abstract**
 Social media is being increasingly weaponized by state-backed actors to elicit reactions, push narratives and sway public opinion. These are known as Information Operations (IO). The covert nature of IO makes their detection difficult. This is further amplified by missing data due to the user and content removal and privacy requirements. This work advances the hypothesis that the very reactions that Information Operations seek to elicit within the target social systems can be used to detect them. We propose an Interval-censored Transformer Hawkes (IC-TH) architecture and a novel data encoding scheme to account for both observed and missing data. We derive a novel log-likelihood function that we deploy together with a contrastive learning procedure. We showcase the performance of IC-TH on three real-world Twitter datasets and two learning tasks: future popularity prediction and item category prediction. The latter is particularly significant. Using the retweeting timing and patterns solely, we can predict the category of YouTube videos, guess whether news publishers are reputable or controversial and, most importantly, identify state-backed IO agent accounts. Additional qualitative investigations uncover that the automatically discovered clusters of Russian-backed agents appear to coordinate their behavior, activating simultaneously to push specific narratives.

 - **Abstract**
 Accurate 6D object pose estimation is an important task for a variety of robotic applications such as grasping or localization. It is a challenging task due to object symmetries, clutter and occlusion, but it becomes more challenging when additional information, such as depth and 3D models, is not provided. We present a transformer-based approach that takes an RGB image as input and predicts a 6D pose for each object in the image. Besides the image, our network does not require any additional information such as depth maps or 3D object models. First, the image is passed through an object detector to generate feature maps and to detect objects. Then, the feature maps are fed into a transformer with the detected bounding boxes as additional information. Afterwards, the output object queries are processed by a separate translation and rotation head. We achieve state-of-the-art results for RGB-only approaches on the challenging YCB-V dataset. We illustrate the suitability of the resulting model as pose sensor for a 6-DoF state estimation task. Code is available at https://github.com/aau-cns/poet.

 - **Abstract**
 Human-object interaction is one of the most important visual cues that has not been explored for egocentric action anticipation. We propose a novel Transformer variant to model interactions by computing the change in the appearance of objects and human hands due to the execution of the actions and use those changes to refine the video representation. Specifically, we model interactions between hands and objects using Spatial Cross-Attention (SCA) and further infuse contextual information using Trajectory Cross-Attention to obtain environment-refined interaction tokens. Using these tokens, we construct an interaction-centric video representation for action anticipation. We term our model InAViT which achieves state-of-the-art action anticipation performance on large-scale egocentric datasets EPICKTICHENS100 (EK100) and EGTEA Gaze+. InAViT outperforms other visual transformer-based methods including object-centric video representation. On the EK100 evaluation server, InAViT is the top-performing method on the public leaderboard (at the time of submission) where it outperforms the second-best model by 3.3% on mean-top5 recall.

 - **Abstract**
 The formidable accomplishment of Transformers in natural language processing has motivated the researchers in the computer vision community to build Vision Transformers. Compared with the Convolution Neural Networks (CNN), a Vision Transformer has a larger receptive field which is capable of characterizing the long-range dependencies. Nevertheless, the large receptive field of Vision Transformer is accompanied by the huge computational cost. To boost efficiency, the window-based Vision Transformers emerge. They crop an image into several local windows, and the self-attention is conducted within each window. To bring back the global receptive field, window-based Vision Transformers have devoted a lot of efforts to achieving cross-window communications by developing several sophisticated operations. In this work, we check the necessity of the key design element of Swin Transformer, the shifted window partitioning. We discover that a simple depthwise convolution is sufficient for achieving effective cross-window communications. Specifically, with the existence of the depthwise convolution, the shifted window configuration in Swin Transformer cannot lead to an additional performance improvement. Thus, we degenerate the Swin Transformer to a plain Window-based (Win) Transformer by discarding sophisticated shifted window partitioning. The proposed Win Transformer is conceptually simpler and easier for implementation than Swin Transformer. Meanwhile, our Win Transformer achieves consistently superior performance than Swin Transformer on multiple computer vision tasks, including image recognition, semantic segmentation, and object detection.

 - **Abstract**
 The rise of generalist large-scale models in natural language and vision has made us expect that a massive data-driven approach could achieve broader generalization in other domains such as continuous control. In this work, we explore a method for learning a single policy that manipulates various forms of agents to solve various tasks by distilling a large amount of proficient behavioral data. In order to align input-output (IO) interface among multiple tasks and diverse agent morphologies while preserving essential 3D geometric relations, we introduce morphology-task graph, which treats observations, actions and goals/task in a unified graph representation. We also develop MxT-Bench for fast large-scale behavior generation, which supports procedural generation of diverse morphology-task combinations with a minimal blueprint and hardware-accelerated simulator. Through efficient representation and architecture selection on MxT-Bench, we find out that a morphology-task graph representation coupled with Transformer architecture improves the multi-task performances compared to other baselines including recent discrete tokenization, and provides better prior knowledge for zero-shot transfer or sample efficiency in downstream multi-task imitation learning. Our work suggests large diverse offline datasets, unified IO representation, and policy representation and architecture selection through supervised learning form a promising approach for studying and advancing morphology-task generalization.

 - **Abstract**
 Inferring the structure of 3D scenes from 2D observations is a fundamental challenge in computer vision. Recently popularized approaches based on neural scene representations have achieved tremendous impact and have been applied across a variety of applications. One of the major remaining challenges in this space is training a single model which can provide latent representations which effectively generalize beyond a single scene. Scene Representation Transformer (SRT) has shown promise in this direction, but scaling it to a larger set of diverse scenes is challenging and necessitates accurately posed ground truth data. To address this problem, we propose RUST (Really Unposed Scene representation Transformer), a pose-free approach to novel view synthesis trained on RGB images alone. Our main insight is that one can train a Pose Encoder that peeks at the target image and learns a latent pose embedding which is used by the decoder for view synthesis. We perform an empirical investigation into the learned latent pose structure and show that it allows meaningful test-time camera transformations and accurate explicit pose readouts. Perhaps surprisingly, RUST achieves similar quality as methods which have access to perfect camera pose, thereby unlocking the potential for large-scale training of amortized neural scene representations.

 - **Abstract**
 The goal of Anomaly-Detection (AD) is to identify outliers, or outlying regions, from some unknown distribution given only a set of positive (good) examples. Few-Shot AD (FSAD) aims to solve the same task with a minimal amount of normal examples. Recent embedding-based methods, that compare the embedding vectors of queries to a set of reference embeddings, have demonstrated impressive results for FSAD, where as little as one good example is provided. A different approach, image-reconstruction-based, has been historically used for AD. The idea is to train a model to recover normal images from corrupted observations, assuming that the model will fail to recover regions when encountered with an out-of-distribution image. However, image-reconstruction-based methods were not yet used in the low-shot regime as they need to be trained on a diverse set of normal images in order to properly perform. We suggest using Masked Auto-Encoder (MAE), a self-supervised transformer model trained for recovering missing image regions based on their surroundings for FSAD. We show that MAE performs well by pre-training on an arbitrary set of natural images (ImageNet) and only fine-tuning on a small set of normal images. We name this method MAEDAY. We further find that MAEDAY provides an orthogonal signal to the embedding-based methods and the ensemble of the two approaches achieves very strong SOTA results. We also present a novel task of Zero-Shot AD (ZSAD) where no normal samples are available at training time. We show that MAEDAY performs surprisingly well at this task. Finally, we provide a new dataset for detecting foreign objects on the ground and demonstrate superior results for this task as well. Code is available at https://github.com/EliSchwartz/MAEDAY .

 - **Abstract**
 With increasingly more computation being shifted to the edge of the network, monitoring of critical infrastructures, such as intermediate processing nodes in autonomous driving, is further complicated due to the typically resource-constrained environments. In order to reduce the resource overhead on the network link imposed by monitoring, various methods have been discussed that either follow a filtering approach for data-emitting devices or conduct dynamic sampling based on employed prediction models. Still, existing methods are mainly requiring adaptive monitoring on edge devices, which demands device reconfigurations, utilizes additional resources, and limits the sophistication of employed models. In this paper, we propose a sampling-based and cloud-located approach that internally utilizes probabilistic forecasts and hence provides means of quantifying model uncertainties, which can be used for contextualized adaptations of sampling frequencies and consequently relieves constrained network resources. We evaluate our prototype implementation for the monitoring pipeline on a publicly available streaming dataset and demonstrate its positive impact on resource efficiency in a method comparison.
