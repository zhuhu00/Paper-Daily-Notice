 - **Abstract**
 We introduce visual hints expansion for guiding stereo matching to improve generalization. Our work is motivated by the robustness of Visual Inertial Odometry (VIO) in computer vision and robotics, where a sparse and unevenly distributed set of feature points characterizes a scene. To improve stereo matching, we propose to elevate 2D hints to 3D points. These sparse and unevenly distributed 3D visual hints are expanded using a 3D random geometric graph, which enhances the learning and inference process. We evaluate our proposal on multiple widely adopted benchmarks and show improved performance without access to additional sensors other than the image sequence. To highlight practical applicability and symbiosis with visual odometry, we demonstrate how our methods run on embedded hardware.

 - **Abstract**
 Total Least Squares (TLS) is an effective method for solving linear equations with the situations, when noise is not just in observation matrices but also mapping matrices. Moreover, Tikhonov regularization is widely used in plenty of ill-posed problems. In this paper, we extend the Regularized Total Least Squares (RTLS) method in matrix form proposed by Golub, Hansen and O'Leary in 1999 to tensor form, proposing the tensor Regularized Total Least Squares (TRTLS) method for solving ill-conditioned tensor systems of equations. Properties and algorithms about the solution of TRTLS problem, which might be similar with those about RTLS, are also proposed and proved. Based on this method, some applications in image and video deblurring are explored in this paper. Numerical experiments show the effectiveness of TRTLS method, compared with the existing methods.

 - **Abstract**
 Image recognition tasks typically use deep learning and require enormous processing power, thus relying on hardware accelerators like GPUs and FPGAs for fast, timely processing. Failure in real-time image recognition tasks can occur due to incorrect mapping on hardware accelerators, which may lead to timing uncertainty and incorrect behavior. Owing to the increased use of image recognition tasks in safety-critical applications like autonomous driving and medical imaging, it is imperative to assess their robustness to changes in the computational environment as parameters like deep learning frameworks, compiler optimizations for code generation, and hardware devices are not regulated with varying impact on model performance and correctness. In this paper we conduct robustness analysis of four popular image recognition models (MobileNetV2, ResNet101V2, DenseNet121 and InceptionV3) with the ImageNet dataset, assessing the impact of the following parameters in the model's computational environment: (1) deep learning frameworks; (2) compiler optimizations; and (3) hardware devices. We report sensitivity of model performance in terms of output label and inference time for changes in each of these environment parameters. We find that output label predictions for all four models are sensitive to choice of deep learning framework (by up to 57%) and insensitive to other parameters. On the other hand, model inference time was affected by all environment parameters with changes in hardware device having the most effect. The extent of effect was not uniform across models.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a novel 3D adaptive observer framework for use in the determination of subsurface organic tissue temperatures in electrosurgery. The observer structure leverages pointwise 2D surface temperature readings obtained from a real-time infrared thermographer for both parameter estimation and temperature field observation. We introduce a novel approach to decoupled parameter adaptation and estimation, wherein the parameter estimation can run in real-time, while the observer loop runs on a slower time scale. To achieve this, we introduce a novel parameter estimation method known as attention-based noise-robust averaging, in which surface thermography time series are used to directly estimate the tissue's diffusivity. Our observer contains a real-time parameter adaptation component based on this diffusivity adaptation law, as well as a Luenberger-type corrector based on the sensed surface temperature. In this work, we also present a novel model structure adapted to the setting of robotic surgery, wherein we model the electrosurgical heat distribution as a compactly supported magnitude- and velocity-controlled heat source involving a new nonlinear input mapping. We demonstrate satisfactory performance of the adaptive observer in simulation, using real-life experimental ex vivo porcine tissue data.

 - **Abstract**
 Neural implicit surface representations have recently emerged as popular alternative to explicit 3D object encodings, such as polygonal meshes, tabulated points, or voxels. While significant work has improved the geometric fidelity of these representations, much less attention is given to their final appearance. Traditional explicit object representations commonly couple the 3D shape data with auxiliary surface-mapped image data, such as diffuse color textures and fine-scale geometric details in normal maps that typically require a mapping of the 3D surface onto a plane, i.e., a surface parameterization; implicit representations, on the other hand, cannot be easily textured due to lack of configurable surface parameterization. Inspired by this digital content authoring methodology, we design a neural network architecture that implicitly encodes the underlying surface parameterization suitable for appearance data. As such, our model remains compatible with existing mesh-based digital content with appearance data. Motivated by recent work that overfits compact networks to individual 3D objects, we present a new weight-encoded neural implicit representation that extends the capability of neural implicit surfaces to enable various common and important applications of texture mapping. Our method outperforms reasonable baselines and state-of-the-art alternatives.

 - **Abstract**
 Recognizing who is speaking in a crowded scene is a key challenge towards the understanding of the social interactions going on within. Detecting speaking status from body movement alone opens the door for the analysis of social scenes in which personal audio is not obtainable. Video and wearable sensors make it possible recognize speaking in an unobtrusive, privacy-preserving way. When considering the video modality, in action recognition problems, a bounding box is traditionally used to localize and segment out the target subject, to then recognize the action taking place within it. However, cross-contamination, occlusion, and the articulated nature of the human body, make this approach challenging in a crowded scene. Here, we leverage articulated body poses for subject localization and in the subsequent speech detection stage. We show that the selection of local features around pose keypoints has a positive effect on generalization performance while also significantly reducing the number of local features considered, making for a more efficient method. Using two in-the-wild datasets with different viewpoints of subjects, we investigate the role of cross-contamination in this effect. We additionally make use of acceleration measured through wearable sensors for the same task, and present a multimodal approach combining both methods.

 - **Abstract**
 COVID-19 has become a matter of serious concern over the last few years. It has adversely affected numerous people around the globe and has led to the loss of billions of dollars of business capital. In this paper, we propose a novel Spatial-Temporal Synchronous Graph Transformer network (STSGT) to capture the complex spatial and temporal dependency of the COVID-19 time series data and forecast the future status of an evolving pandemic. The layers of STSGT combine the graph convolution network (GCN) with the self-attention mechanism of transformers on a synchronous spatial-temporal graph to capture the dynamically changing pattern of the COVID time series. The spatial-temporal synchronous graph simultaneously captures the spatial and temporal dependencies between the vertices of the graph at a given and subsequent time-steps, which helps capture the heterogeneity in the time series and improve the forecasting accuracy. Our extensive experiments on two publicly available real-world COVID-19 time series datasets demonstrate that STSGT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms that were designed for spatial-temporal forecasting tasks. Specifically, on average over a 12-day horizon, we observe a potential improvement of 12.19% and 3.42% in Mean Absolute Error(MAE) over the next best algorithm while forecasting the daily infected and death cases respectively for the 50 states of US and Washington, D.C. Additionally, STSGT also outperformed others when forecasting the daily infected cases at the state level, e.g., for all the counties in the State of Michigan. The code and models are publicly available at https://github.com/soumbane/STSGT.
### What is my math transformer doing? -- Three results on interpretability  and generalization

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00170
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.00170
 - **Abstract**
 This paper investigates the failure cases and out-of-distribution behavior of transformers trained on matrix inversion and eigenvalue decomposition. I show that incorrect model predictions still retain deep mathematical properties of the solution (e.g. correct eigenvalues, unit norm of eigenvectors), and that almost all model failures can be attributed to, and predicted from, properties of the problem or solution. This demonstrates that, when in doubt, math transformers do not hallucinate absurd solutions (as was sometimes proposed) but remain ``roughly right''. I also show that the careful choice of a training dataset can accelerate training, while allowing the model to generalize out of its training distribution, invalidating the idea that transformers ``merely interpolate'' from memorized examples.

 - **Abstract**
 The need for emotional inference from text continues to diversify as more and more disciplines integrate emotions into their theories and applications. These needs include inferring different emotion types, handling multiple languages, and different annotation formats. A shared model between different configurations would enable the sharing of knowledge and a decrease in training costs, and would simplify the process of deploying emotion recognition models in novel environments. In this work, we study how we can build a single model that can transition between these different configurations by leveraging multilingual models and Demux, a transformer-based model whose input includes the emotions of interest, enabling us to dynamically change the emotions predicted by the model. Demux also produces emotion embeddings, and performing operations on them allows us to transition to clusters of emotions by pooling the embeddings of each cluster. We show that Demux can simultaneously transfer knowledge in a zero-shot manner to a new language, to a novel annotation format and to unseen emotions. Code is available at https://github.com/gchochla/Demux-MEmo .
### Joint Audio/Text Training for Transformer Rescorer of Streaming Speech  Recognition

 - **Abstract**
 Recently, there has been an increasing interest in two-pass streaming end-to-end speech recognition (ASR) that incorporates a 2nd-pass rescoring model on top of the conventional 1st-pass streaming ASR model to improve recognition accuracy while keeping latency low. One of the latest 2nd-pass rescoring model, Transformer Rescorer, takes the n-best initial outputs and audio embeddings from the 1st-pass model, and then choose the best output by re-scoring the n-best initial outputs. However, training this Transformer Rescorer requires expensive paired audio-text training data because the model uses audio embeddings as input. In this work, we present our Joint Audio/Text training method for Transformer Rescorer, to leverage unpaired text-only data which is relatively cheaper than paired audio-text data. We evaluate Transformer Rescorer with our Joint Audio/Text training on Librispeech dataset as well as our large-scale in-house dataset and show that our training method can improve word error rate (WER) significantly compared to standard Transformer Rescorer without requiring any extra model parameters or latency.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.00201
 - **Abstract**
 Clinical Cohort Studies (CCS) are a great source of documented clinical research. Ideally, a clinical expert will interpret these articles for exploratory analysis ranging from drug discovery for evaluating the efficacy of existing drugs in tackling emerging diseases to the first test of newly developed drugs. However, more than 100 CCS articles are published on PubMed every day. As a result, it can take days for a doctor to find articles and extract relevant information. Can we find a way to quickly sift through the long list of these articles faster and document the crucial takeaways from each of these articles? In this work, we propose CCS Explorer, an end-to-end system for relevance prediction of sentences, extractive summarization, and patient, outcome, and intervention entity detection from CCS. CCS Explorer is packaged in a web-based graphical user interface where the user can provide any disease name. CCS Explorer then extracts and aggregates all relevant information from articles on PubMed based on the results of an automatically generated query produced on the back-end. CCS Explorer fine-tunes pre-trained language models based on transformers with additional layers for each of these tasks. We evaluate the models using two publicly available datasets. CCS Explorer obtains a recall of 80.2%, AUC-ROC of 0.843, and an accuracy of 88.3% on sentence relevance prediction using BioBERT and achieves an average Micro F1-Score of 77.8% on Patient, Intervention, Outcome detection (PIO) using PubMedBERT. Thus, CCS Explorer can reliably extract relevant information to summarize articles, saving time by ~ 660$\times$.
### LinkFormer: Automatic Contextualised Link Recovery of Software Artifacts  in both Project-based and Transfer Learning Settings

 - **Abstract**
 Software artifacts often interact with each other throughout the software development cycle. Associating related artifacts is a common practice for effective documentation and maintenance of software projects. Conventionally, to register the link between an issue report and its associated commit, developers manually include the issue identifier in the message of the relevant commit. Research has shown that developers tend to forget to connect said artifacts manually, resulting in a loss of links. Hence, several link recovery techniques were proposed to discover and revive such links automatically. However, the literature mainly focuses on improving the prediction accuracy on a randomly-split test set, while neglecting other important aspects of this problem, including the effect of time and generalizability of the predictive models. In this paper, we propose LinkFormer to address this problem from three aspects; 1) Accuracy: To better utilize contextual information for prediction, we employ the Transformer architecture and fine-tune multiple pre-trained models on textual and metadata of issues and commits. 2) Data leakage: To empirically assess the impact of time through the splitting policy, we train and test our proposed model along with several existing approaches on both randomly- and temporally split data. 3) Generalizability: To provide a generic model that can perform well across different projects, we further fine-tune LinkFormer in two transfer learning settings. We empirically show that researchers should preserve the temporal flow of data when training learning-based models to resemble the real-world setting. In addition, LinkFormer significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art by large margins. LinkFormer is also capable of extending the knowledge it learned to unseen projects with little to no historical data.
### VarMAE: Pre-training of Variational Masked Autoencoder for  Domain-adaptive Language Understanding

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.00430
 - **Abstract**
 Pre-trained language models have achieved promising performance on general benchmarks, but underperform when migrated to a specific domain. Recent works perform pre-training from scratch or continual pre-training on domain corpora. However, in many specific domains, the limited corpus can hardly support obtaining precise representations. To address this issue, we propose a novel Transformer-based language model named VarMAE for domain-adaptive language understanding. Under the masked autoencoding objective, we design a context uncertainty learning module to encode the token's context into a smooth latent distribution. The module can produce diverse and well-formed contextual representations. Experiments on science- and finance-domain NLU tasks demonstrate that VarMAE can be efficiently adapted to new domains with limited resources.

### Informed Priors for Knowledge Integration in Trajectory Prediction

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00348
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.00348
 - **Abstract**
 Informed machine learning methods allow the integration of prior knowledge into learning systems. This can increase accuracy and robustness or reduce data needs. However, existing methods often assume hard constraining knowledge, that does not require to trade-off prior knowledge with observations, but can be used to directly reduce the problem space. Other approaches use specific, architectural changes as representation of prior knowledge, limiting applicability. We propose an informed machine learning method, based on continual learning. This allows the integration of arbitrary, prior knowledge, potentially from multiple sources, and does not require specific architectures. Furthermore, our approach enables probabilistic and multi-modal predictions, that can improve predictive accuracy and robustness. We exemplify our approach by applying it to a state-of-the-art trajectory predictor for autonomous driving. This domain is especially dependent on informed learning approaches, as it is subject to an overwhelming large variety of possible environments and very rare events, while requiring robust and accurate predictions. We evaluate our model on a commonly used benchmark dataset, only using data already available in a conventional setup. We show that our method outperforms both non-informed and informed learning methods, that are often used in the literature. Furthermore, we are able to compete with a conventional baseline, even using half as many observation examples.
### Exploring Effects of Computational Parameter Changes to Image  Recognition Systems

 - **Abstract**
 Image recognition tasks typically use deep learning and require enormous processing power, thus relying on hardware accelerators like GPUs and FPGAs for fast, timely processing. Failure in real-time image recognition tasks can occur due to incorrect mapping on hardware accelerators, which may lead to timing uncertainty and incorrect behavior. Owing to the increased use of image recognition tasks in safety-critical applications like autonomous driving and medical imaging, it is imperative to assess their robustness to changes in the computational environment as parameters like deep learning frameworks, compiler optimizations for code generation, and hardware devices are not regulated with varying impact on model performance and correctness. In this paper we conduct robustness analysis of four popular image recognition models (MobileNetV2, ResNet101V2, DenseNet121 and InceptionV3) with the ImageNet dataset, assessing the impact of the following parameters in the model's computational environment: (1) deep learning frameworks; (2) compiler optimizations; and (3) hardware devices. We report sensitivity of model performance in terms of output label and inference time for changes in each of these environment parameters. We find that output label predictions for all four models are sensitive to choice of deep learning framework (by up to 57%) and insensitive to other parameters. On the other hand, model inference time was affected by all environment parameters with changes in hardware device having the most effect. The extent of effect was not uniform across models.
