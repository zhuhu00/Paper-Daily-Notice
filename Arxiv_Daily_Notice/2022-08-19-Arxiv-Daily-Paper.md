 - **Abstract**
 This paper introduces pixel-wise prediction based visual odometry (PWVO), which is a dense prediction task that evaluates the values of translation and rotation for every pixel in its input observations. PWVO employs uncertainty estimation to identify the noisy regions in the input observations, and adopts a selection mechanism to integrate pixel-wise predictions based on the estimated uncertainty maps to derive the final translation and rotation. In order to train PWVO in a comprehensive fashion, we further develop a data generation workflow for generating synthetic training data. The experimental results show that PWVO is able to deliver favorable results. In addition, our analyses validate the effectiveness of the designs adopted in PWVO, and demonstrate that the uncertainty maps estimated by PWVO is capable of capturing the noises in its input observations.

 - **Abstract**
 This work addresses visual cross-view metric localization for outdoor robotics. Given a ground-level color image and a satellite patch that contains the local surroundings, the task is to identify the location of the ground camera within the satellite patch. Related work addressed this task for range-sensors (LiDAR, Radar), but for vision, only as a secondary regression step after an initial cross-view image retrieval step. Since the local satellite patch could also be retrieved through any rough localization prior (e.g. from GPS/GNSS, temporal filtering), we drop the image retrieval objective and focus on the metric localization only. We devise a novel network architecture with denser satellite descriptors, similarity matching at the bottleneck (rather than at the output as in image retrieval), and a dense spatial distribution as output to capture multi-modal localization ambiguities. We compare against a state-of-the-art regression baseline that uses global image descriptors. Quantitative and qualitative experimental results on the recently proposed VIGOR and the Oxford RobotCar datasets validate our design. The produced probabilities are correlated with localization accuracy, and can even be used to roughly estimate the ground camera's heading when its orientation is unknown. Overall, our method reduces the median metric localization error by 51%, 37%, and 28% compared to the state-of-the-art when generalizing respectively in the same area, across areas, and across time.

 Current efficient LiDAR-based detection frameworks are lacking in exploiting object relations, which naturally present in both spatial and temporal manners. To this end, we introduce a simple, efficient, and effective two-stage detector, termed as Ret3D. At the core of Ret3D is the utilization of novel intra-frame and inter-frame relation modules to capture the spatial and temporal relations accordingly. More Specifically, intra-frame relation module (IntraRM) encapsulates the intra-frame objects into a sparse graph and thus allows us to refine the object features through efficient message passing. On the other hand, inter-frame relation module (InterRM) densely connects each object in its corresponding tracked sequences dynamically, and leverages such temporal information to further enhance its representations efficiently through a lightweight transformer network. We instantiate our novel designs of IntraRM and InterRM with general center-based or anchor-based detectors and evaluate them on Waymo Open Dataset (WOD). With negligible extra overhead, Ret3D achieves the state-of-the-art performance, being 5.5% and 3.2% higher than the recent competitor in terms of the LEVEL 1 and LEVEL 2 mAPH metrics on vehicle detection, respectively.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a novel paradigm of building an animatable 3D human representation from a monocular video input, such that it can be rendered in any unseen poses and views. Our method is based on a dynamic Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) rigged by a mesh-based parametric 3D human model serving as a geometry proxy. Previous methods usually rely on multi-view videos or accurate 3D geometry information as additional inputs; besides, most methods suffer from degraded quality when generalized to unseen poses. We identify that the key to generalization is a good input embedding for querying dynamic NeRF: A good input embedding should define an injective mapping in the full volumetric space, guided by surface mesh deformation under pose variation. Based on this observation, we propose to embed the input query with its relationship to local surface regions spanned by a set of geodesic nearest neighbors on mesh vertices. By including both position and relative distance information, our embedding defines a distance-preserved deformation mapping and generalizes well to unseen poses. To reduce the dependency on additional inputs, we first initialize per-frame 3D meshes using off-the-shelf tools and then propose a pipeline to jointly optimize NeRF and refine the initial mesh. Extensive experiments show our method can synthesize plausible human rendering results under unseen poses and views.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the problems of model estimation and reward-free learning in episodic Block MDPs. In these MDPs, the decision maker has access to rich observations or contexts generated from a small number of latent states. We are first interested in estimating the latent state decoding function (the mapping from the observations to latent states) based on data generated under a fixed behavior policy. We derive an information-theoretical lower bound on the error rate for estimating this function and present an algorithm approaching this fundamental limit. In turn, our algorithm also provides estimates of all the components of the MDP. We then study the problem of learning near-optimal policies in the reward-free framework. Based on our efficient model estimation algorithm, we show that we can infer a policy converging (as the number of collected samples grows large) to the optimal policy at the best possible rate. Interestingly, our analysis provides necessary and sufficient conditions under which exploiting the block structure yields improvements in the sample complexity for identifying near-optimal policies. When these conditions are met, the sample complexity in the minimax reward-free setting is improved by a multiplicative factor $n$, where $n$ is the number of possible contexts.

 - **Abstract**
 User videos shared on social media platforms usually suffer from degradations caused by unknown proprietary processing procedures, which means that their visual quality is poorer than that of the originals. This paper presents a new general video restoration framework for the restoration of user videos shared on social media platforms. In contrast to most deep learning-based video restoration methods that perform end-to-end mapping, where feature extraction is mostly treated as a black box, in the sense that what role a feature plays is often unknown, our new method, termed Video restOration through adapTive dEgradation Sensing (VOTES), introduces the concept of a degradation feature map (DFM) to explicitly guide the video restoration process. Specifically, for each video frame, we first adaptively estimate its DFM to extract features representing the difficulty of restoring its different regions. We then feed the DFM to a convolutional neural network (CNN) to compute hierarchical degradation features to modulate an end-to-end video restoration backbone network, such that more attention is paid explicitly to potentially more difficult to restore areas, which in turn leads to enhanced restoration performance. We will explain the design rationale of the VOTES framework and present extensive experimental results to show that the new VOTES method outperforms various state-of-the-art techniques both quantitatively and qualitatively. In addition, we contribute a large scale real-world database of user videos shared on different social media platforms. Codes and datasets are available at https://github.com/luohongming/VOTES.git

 - **Abstract**
 Text-based person retrieval aims to find the query person based on a textual description. The key is to learn a common latent space mapping between visual-textual modalities. To achieve this goal, existing works employ segmentation to obtain explicitly cross-modal alignments or utilize attention to explore salient alignments. These methods have two shortcomings: 1) Labeling cross-modal alignments are time-consuming. 2) Attention methods can explore salient cross-modal alignments but may ignore some subtle and valuable pairs. To relieve these issues, we introduce an Implicit Visual-Textual (IVT) framework for text-based person retrieval. Different from previous models, IVT utilizes a single network to learn representation for both modalities, which contributes to the visual-textual interaction. To explore the fine-grained alignment, we further propose two implicit semantic alignment paradigms: multi-level alignment (MLA) and bidirectional mask modeling (BMM). The MLA module explores finer matching at sentence, phrase, and word levels, while the BMM module aims to mine \textbf{more} semantic alignments between visual and textual modalities. Extensive experiments are carried out to evaluate the proposed IVT on public datasets, i.e., CUHK-PEDES, RSTPReID, and ICFG-PEDES. Even without explicit body part alignment, our approach still achieves state-of-the-art performance. Code is available at: https://github.com/TencentYoutuResearch/PersonRetrieval-IVT.

 - **Abstract**
 Recently unsupervised person re-identification (re-ID) has drawn much attention due to its open-world scenario settings where limited annotated data is available. Existing supervised methods often fail to generalize well on unseen domains, while the unsupervised methods, mostly lack multi-granularity information and are prone to suffer from confirmation bias. In this paper, we aim at finding better feature representations on the unseen target domain from two aspects, 1) performing unsupervised domain adaptation on the labeled source domain and 2) mining potential similarities on the unlabeled target domain. Besides, a collaborative pseudo re-labeling strategy is proposed to alleviate the influence of confirmation bias. Firstly, a generative adversarial network is utilized to transfer images from the source domain to the target domain. Moreover, person identity preserving and identity mapping losses are introduced to improve the quality of generated images. Secondly, we propose a novel collaborative multiple feature clustering framework (CMFC) to learn the internal data structure of target domain, including global feature and partial feature branches. The global feature branch (GB) employs unsupervised clustering on the global feature of person images while the Partial feature branch (PB) mines similarities within different body regions. Finally, extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets show the competitive performance of our method under unsupervised person re-ID settings.

 - **Abstract**
 Timely and accurate land use mapping is a long-standing problem, which is critical for effective land and space planning and management. Due to complex and mixed use, it is challenging for accurate land use mapping from widely-used remote sensing images (RSI) directly, especially for high-density cities. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a coarse-to-fine machine learning-based approach for parcel-level urban land use mapping, integrating multisource geospatial data, including RSI, points-of-interest (POI), and area-of-interest (AOI) data. Specifically, we first divide the city into built-up and non-built-up regions based on parcels generated from road networks. Then, we adopt different classification strategies for parcels in different regions, and finally combine the classified results into an integrated land use map. The results show that the proposed approach can significantly outperform baseline method that mixes built-up and non-built-up regions, with accuracy increase of 25% and 30% for level-1 and level-2 classification, respectively. In addition, we examine the rarely explored AOI data, which can further boost the level-1 and level-2 classification accuracy by 13% and 14%. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach and also indicate the usefulness of AOIs for land use mapping, which are valuable for further studies.

 - **Abstract**
 StyleGAN family is one of the most popular Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for unconditional generation. Despite its impressive performance, its high demand on storage and computation impedes their deployment on resource-constrained devices. This paper provides a comprehensive study of distilling from the popular StyleGAN-like architecture. Our key insight is that the main challenge of StyleGAN distillation lies in the output discrepancy issue, where the teacher and student model yield different outputs given the same input latent code. Standard knowledge distillation losses typically fail under this heterogeneous distillation scenario. We conduct thorough analysis about the reasons and effects of this discrepancy issue, and identify that the mapping network plays a vital role in determining semantic information of generated images. Based on this finding, we propose a novel initialization strategy for the student model, which can ensure the output consistency to the maximum extent. To further enhance the semantic consistency between the teacher and student model, we present a latent-direction-based distillation loss that preserves the semantic relations in latent space. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in distilling StyleGAN2 and StyleGAN3, outperforming existing GAN distillation methods by a large margin.

 - **Abstract**
 People with blindness and low vision (pBLV) experience significant challenges when locating final destinations or targeting specific objects in unfamiliar environments. Furthermore, besides initially locating and orienting oneself to a target object, approaching the final target from one's present position is often frustrating and challenging, especially when one drifts away from the initial planned path to avoid obstacles. In this paper, we develop a novel wearable navigation solution to provide real-time guidance for a user to approach a target object of interest efficiently and effectively in unfamiliar environments. Our system contains two key visual computing functions: initial target object localization in 3D and continuous estimation of the user's trajectory, both based on the 2D video captured by a low-cost monocular camera mounted on in front of the chest of the user. These functions enable the system to suggest an initial navigation path, continuously update the path as the user moves, and offer timely recommendation about the correction of the user's path. Our experiments demonstrate that our system is able to operate with an error of less than 0.5 meter both outdoor and indoor. The system is entirely vision-based and does not need other sensors for navigation, and the computation can be run with the Jetson processor in the wearable system to facilitate real-time navigation assistance.

 - **Abstract**
 The effective representation, precessing, analysis, and visualization of large-scale structured data over graphs are gaining a lot of attention. So far most of the literature has focused on real-valued signals. However, signals are often sparse in the Fourier domain, and more informative and compact representations for them can be obtained using the complex envelope of their spectral components, as opposed to the original real-valued signals. Motivated by this fact, in this work we generalize graph convolutional neural networks (GCN) to the complex domain, deriving the theory that allows to incorporate a complex-valued graph shift operators (GSO) in the definition of graph filters (GF) and process complex-valued graph signals (GS). The theory developed can handle spatio-temporal complex network processes. We prove that complex-valued GCNs are stable with respect to perturbations of the underlying graph support, the bound of the transfer error and the bound of error propagation through multiply layers. Then we apply complex GCN to power grid state forecasting, power grid cyber-attack detection and localization.

 - **Abstract**
 This work addresses visual cross-view metric localization for outdoor robotics. Given a ground-level color image and a satellite patch that contains the local surroundings, the task is to identify the location of the ground camera within the satellite patch. Related work addressed this task for range-sensors (LiDAR, Radar), but for vision, only as a secondary regression step after an initial cross-view image retrieval step. Since the local satellite patch could also be retrieved through any rough localization prior (e.g. from GPS/GNSS, temporal filtering), we drop the image retrieval objective and focus on the metric localization only. We devise a novel network architecture with denser satellite descriptors, similarity matching at the bottleneck (rather than at the output as in image retrieval), and a dense spatial distribution as output to capture multi-modal localization ambiguities. We compare against a state-of-the-art regression baseline that uses global image descriptors. Quantitative and qualitative experimental results on the recently proposed VIGOR and the Oxford RobotCar datasets validate our design. The produced probabilities are correlated with localization accuracy, and can even be used to roughly estimate the ground camera's heading when its orientation is unknown. Overall, our method reduces the median metric localization error by 51%, 37%, and 28% compared to the state-of-the-art when generalizing respectively in the same area, across areas, and across time.
### Learning Spatial-Frequency Transformer for Visual Object Tracking

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.08829
 - **Abstract**
 Recent trackers adopt the Transformer to combine or replace the widely used ResNet as their new backbone network. Although their trackers work well in regular scenarios, however, they simply flatten the 2D features into a sequence to better match the Transformer. We believe these operations ignore the spatial prior of the target object which may lead to sub-optimal results only. In addition, many works demonstrate that self-attention is actually a low-pass filter, which is independent of input features or key/queries. That is to say, it may suppress the high-frequency component of the input features and preserve or even amplify the low-frequency information. To handle these issues, in this paper, we propose a unified Spatial-Frequency Transformer that models the Gaussian spatial Prior and High-frequency emphasis Attention (GPHA) simultaneously. To be specific, Gaussian spatial prior is generated using dual Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) and injected into the similarity matrix produced by multiplying Query and Key features in self-attention. The output will be fed into a Softmax layer and then decomposed into two components, i.e., the direct signal and high-frequency signal. The low- and high-pass branches are rescaled and combined to achieve all-pass, therefore, the high-frequency features will be protected well in stacked self-attention layers. We further integrate the Spatial-Frequency Transformer into the Siamese tracking framework and propose a novel tracking algorithm, termed SFTransT. The cross-scale fusion based SwinTransformer is adopted as the backbone, and also a multi-head cross-attention module is used to boost the interaction between search and template features. The output will be fed into the tracking head for target localization. Extensive experiments on both short-term and long-term tracking benchmarks all demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.08880
 - **Abstract**
 The use of Augmented Reality (AR) for navigation purposes has shown beneficial in assisting physicians during the performance of surgical procedures. These applications commonly require knowing the pose of surgical tools and patients to provide visual information that surgeons can use during the task performance. Existing medical-grade tracking systems use infrared cameras placed inside the Operating Room (OR) to identify retro-reflective markers attached to objects of interest and compute their pose. Some commercially available AR Head-Mounted Displays (HMDs) use similar cameras for self-localization, hand tracking, and estimating the objects' depth. This work presents a framework that uses the built-in cameras of AR HMDs to enable accurate tracking of retro-reflective markers, such as those used in surgical procedures, without the need to integrate any additional components. This framework is also capable of simultaneously tracking multiple tools. Our results show that the tracking and detection of the markers can be achieved with an accuracy of 0.09 +- 0.06 mm on lateral translation, 0.42 +- 0.32 mm on longitudinal translation, and 0.80 +- 0.39 deg for rotations around the vertical axis. Furthermore, to showcase the relevance of the proposed framework, we evaluate the system's performance in the context of surgical procedures. This use case was designed to replicate the scenarios of k-wire insertions in orthopedic procedures. For evaluation, two surgeons and one biomedical researcher were provided with visual navigation, each performing 21 injections. Results from this use case provide comparable accuracy to those reported in the literature for AR-based navigation procedures.

 - **Abstract**
 This work proposes a framework for the patient-specific characterization of the spine, which integrates information on the tissues with geometric information on the spine morphology. Key elements are the extraction of 3D patient-specific models of each vertebra and the intervertebral space from 3D CT images, the segmentation of each vertebra in its three functional regions, and the analysis of the tissue condition in the functional regions based on geometrical parameters. The localization of anomalies obtained in the results and the proposed visualization support the applicability of our tool for quantitative and visual evaluation of possible damages, for surgery planning, and early diagnosis or follow-up studies. Finally, we discuss the main properties of the proposed framework in terms of characterisation of the morphology and pathology of the spine on benchmarks of the spine district.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a conceptually simple, flexible, and universal visual perception head for variant visual tasks, e.g., classification, object detection, instance segmentation and pose estimation, and different frameworks, such as one-stage or two-stage pipelines. Our approach effectively identifies an object in an image while simultaneously generating a high-quality bounding box or contour-based segmentation mask or set of keypoints. The method, called UniHead, views different visual perception tasks as the dispersible points learning via the transformer encoder architecture. Given a fixed spatial coordinate, UniHead adaptively scatters it to different spatial points and reasons about their relations by transformer encoder. It directly outputs the final set of predictions in the form of multiple points, allowing us to perform different visual tasks in different frameworks with the same head design. We show extensive evaluations on ImageNet classification and all three tracks of the COCO suite of challenges, including object detection, instance segmentation and pose estimation. Without bells and whistles, UniHead can unify these visual tasks via a single visual head design and achieve comparable performance compared to expert models developed for each task.We hope our simple and universal UniHead will serve as a solid baseline and help promote universal visual perception research. Code and models are available at https://github.com/Sense-X/UniHead.

 - **Abstract**
 When using deep learning techniques to model program languages, neural networks with tree or graph structures are widely adopted to capture the rich structural information within program abstract syntax trees (AST). However, long-term/global dependencies widely exist in programs, and most of these neural architectures fail to capture these dependencies. In this paper, we propose Tree-Transformer, a novel recursive tree-structured neural network which aims to overcome the above limitations. Tree-Transformer leverages two multi-head attention units to model the dependency between siblings and parent-children node pairs. Moreover, we propose a bi-directional propagation strategy to allow node information passing in two directions: bottom-up and top-down along trees. By combining bottom-up and top-down propagation, Tree-Transformer can learn both global contexts and meaningful node features. The extensive experimental results show that our Tree-Transformer outperforms existing tree-based or graph-based neural networks in program-related tasks with tree-level and node-level prediction tasks, indicating that Tree-Transformer performs well on learning both tree-level and node-level representations.
### Exploring and Exploiting Multi-Granularity Representations for Machine  Reading Comprehension

 - **Abstract**
 Recently, the attention-enhanced multi-layer encoder, such as Transformer, has been extensively studied in Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC). To predict the answer, it is common practice to employ a predictor to draw information only from the final encoder layer which generates the coarse-grained representations of the source sequences, i.e., passage and question. The analysis shows that the representation of source sequence becomes more coarse-grained from finegrained as the encoding layer increases. It is generally believed that with the growing number of layers in deep neural networks, the encoding process will gather relevant information for each location increasingly, resulting in more coarse-grained representations, which adds the likelihood of similarity to other locations (referring to homogeneity). Such phenomenon will mislead the model to make wrong judgement and degrade the performance. In this paper, we argue that it would be better if the predictor could exploit representations of different granularity from the encoder, providing different views of the source sequences, such that the expressive power of the model could be fully utilized. To this end, we propose a novel approach called Adaptive Bidirectional Attention-Capsule Network (ABA-Net), which adaptively exploits the source representations of different levels to the predictor. Furthermore, due to the better representations are at the core for boosting MRC performance, the capsule network and self-attention module are carefully designed as the building blocks of our encoders, which provides the capability to explore the local and global representations, respectively. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets, i.e., SQuAD 1.0, SQuAD 2.0 and COQA, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. In particular, we set the new state-of-the-art performance on the SQuAD 1.0 dataset

 - **Abstract**
 Recent trackers adopt the Transformer to combine or replace the widely used ResNet as their new backbone network. Although their trackers work well in regular scenarios, however, they simply flatten the 2D features into a sequence to better match the Transformer. We believe these operations ignore the spatial prior of the target object which may lead to sub-optimal results only. In addition, many works demonstrate that self-attention is actually a low-pass filter, which is independent of input features or key/queries. That is to say, it may suppress the high-frequency component of the input features and preserve or even amplify the low-frequency information. To handle these issues, in this paper, we propose a unified Spatial-Frequency Transformer that models the Gaussian spatial Prior and High-frequency emphasis Attention (GPHA) simultaneously. To be specific, Gaussian spatial prior is generated using dual Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) and injected into the similarity matrix produced by multiplying Query and Key features in self-attention. The output will be fed into a Softmax layer and then decomposed into two components, i.e., the direct signal and high-frequency signal. The low- and high-pass branches are rescaled and combined to achieve all-pass, therefore, the high-frequency features will be protected well in stacked self-attention layers. We further integrate the Spatial-Frequency Transformer into the Siamese tracking framework and propose a novel tracking algorithm, termed SFTransT. The cross-scale fusion based SwinTransformer is adopted as the backbone, and also a multi-head cross-attention module is used to boost the interaction between search and template features. The output will be fed into the tracking head for target localization. Extensive experiments on both short-term and long-term tracking benchmarks all demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.

 - **Abstract**
 Vision transformers are nowadays the de-facto preference for image classification tasks. There are two broad categories of classification tasks, fine-grained and coarse-grained. In fine-grained classification, the necessity is to discover subtle differences due to the high level of similarity between sub-classes. Such distinctions are often lost as we downscale the image to save the memory and computational cost associated with vision transformers (ViT). In this work, we present an in-depth analysis and describe the critical components for developing a system for the fine-grained categorization of plants from herbarium sheets. Our extensive experimental analysis indicated the need for a better augmentation technique and the ability of modern-day neural networks to handle higher dimensional images. We also introduce a convolutional transformer architecture called Conviformer which, unlike the popular Vision Transformer (ConViT), can handle higher resolution images without exploding memory and computational cost. We also introduce a novel, improved pre-processing technique called PreSizer to resize images better while preserving their original aspect ratios, which proved essential for classifying natural plants. With our simple yet effective approach, we achieved SoTA on Herbarium 202x and iNaturalist 2019 dataset.
### Prompt Vision Transformer for Domain Generalization

 - **Abstract**
 Though vision transformers (ViTs) have exhibited impressive ability for representation learning, we empirically find that they cannot generalize well to unseen domains with previous domain generalization algorithms. In this paper, we propose a novel approach DoPrompt based on prompt learning to embed the knowledge of source domains in domain prompts for target domain prediction. Specifically, domain prompts are prepended before ViT input tokens from the corresponding source domain. Each domain prompt learns domain-specific knowledge efficiently since it is optimized only for one domain. Meanwhile, we train a prompt adapter to produce a suitable prompt for each input image based on the learned source domain prompts. At test time, the adapted prompt generated by the prompt adapter can exploit the similarity between the feature of the out-of-domain image and source domains to properly integrate the source domain knowledge. Extensive experiments are conducted on four benchmark datasets. Our approach achieves 1.4% improvements in the averaged accuracy, which is 3.5 times the improvement of the state-of-the-art algorithm with a ViT backbone.

 - **Abstract**
 Grounded Situation Recognition (GSR) aims to generate structured semantic summaries of images for ``human-like'' event understanding. Specifically, GSR task not only detects the salient activity verb (e.g. buying), but also predicts all corresponding semantic roles (e.g. agent and goods). Inspired by object detection and image captioning tasks, existing methods typically employ a two-stage framework: 1) detect the activity verb, and then 2) predict semantic roles based on the detected verb. Obviously, this illogical framework constitutes a huge obstacle to semantic understanding. First, pre-detecting verbs solely without semantic roles inevitably fails to distinguish many similar daily activities (e.g., offering and giving, buying and selling). Second, predicting semantic roles in a closed auto-regressive manner can hardly exploit the semantic relations among the verb and roles. To this end, in this paper we propose a novel two-stage framework that focuses on utilizing such bidirectional relations within verbs and roles. In the first stage, instead of pre-detecting the verb, we postpone the detection step and assume a pseudo label, where an intermediate representation for each corresponding semantic role is learned from images. In the second stage, we exploit transformer layers to unearth the potential semantic relations within both verbs and semantic roles. With the help of a set of support images, an alternate learning scheme is designed to simultaneously optimize the results: update the verb using nouns corresponding to the image, and update nouns using verbs from support images. Extensive experimental results on challenging SWiG benchmarks show that our renovated framework outperforms other state-of-the-art methods under various metrics.
### Open-Vocabulary Panoptic Segmentation with MaskCLIP

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we tackle a new computer vision task, open-vocabulary panoptic segmentation, that aims to perform panoptic segmentation (background semantic labeling + foreground instance segmentation) for arbitrary categories of text-based descriptions. We first build a baseline method without finetuning nor distillation to utilize the knowledge in the existing CLIP model. We then develop a new method, MaskCLIP, that is a Transformer-based approach using mask queries with the ViT-based CLIP backbone to perform semantic segmentation and object instance segmentation. Here we design a Relative Mask Attention (RMA) module to account for segmentations as additional tokens to the ViT CLIP model. MaskCLIP learns to efficiently and effectively utilize pre-trained dense/local CLIP features by avoiding the time-consuming operation to crop image patches and compute feature from an external CLIP image model. We obtain encouraging results for open-vocabulary panoptic segmentation and state-of-the-art results for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation on ADE20K and PASCAL datasets. We show qualitative illustration for MaskCLIP with custom categories.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a simple baseline for directly estimating the relative pose (rotation and translation, including scale) between two images. Deep methods have recently shown strong progress but often require complex or multi-stage architectures. We show that a handful of modifications can be applied to a Vision Transformer (ViT) to bring its computations close to the Eight-Point Algorithm. This inductive bias enables a simple method to be competitive in multiple settings, often substantially improving over the state of the art with strong performance gains in limited data regimes.

 - **Abstract**
 The boundaries of existing explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) algorithms are confined to problems grounded in technical users' demand for explainability. This research paradigm disproportionately ignores the larger group of non-technical end users of XAI, who do not have technical knowledge but need explanations in their AI-assisted critical decisions. Lacking explainability-focused functional support for end users may hinder the safe and responsible use of AI in high-stakes domains, such as healthcare, criminal justice, finance, and autonomous driving systems. In this work, we explore how designing XAI tailored to end users' critical tasks inspires the framing of new technical problems. To elicit users' interpretations and requirements for XAI algorithms, we first identify eight explanation forms as the communication tool between AI researchers and end users, such as explaining using features, examples, or rules. Using the explanation forms, we then conduct a user study with 32 layperson participants in the context of achieving different explanation goals (such as verifying AI decisions, and improving user's predicted outcomes) in four critical tasks. Based on the user study findings, we identify and formulate novel XAI technical problems, and propose an evaluation metric verifiability based on users' explanation goal of verifying AI decisions. Our work shows that grounding the technical problem in end users' use of XAI can inspire new research questions. Such end-user-inspired research questions have the potential to promote social good by democratizing AI and ensuring the responsible use of AI in critical domains.
