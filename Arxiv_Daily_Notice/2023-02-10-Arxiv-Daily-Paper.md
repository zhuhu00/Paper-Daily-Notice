 - **Abstract**
 The recent advancements in wireless technology enable connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) to gather data via vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication, such as processed LIDAR and camera data from other vehicles. In this work, we design an integrated information sharing and safe multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework for CAVs, to take advantage of the extra information when making decisions to improve traffic efficiency and safety. We first use weight pruned convolutional neural networks (CNN) to process the raw image and point cloud LIDAR data locally at each autonomous vehicle, and share CNN-output data with neighboring CAVs. We then design a safe actor-critic algorithm that utilizes both a vehicle's local observation and the information received via V2V communication to explore an efficient behavior planning policy with safety guarantees. Using the CARLA simulator for experiments, we show that our approach improves the CAV system's efficiency in terms of average velocity and comfort under different CAV ratios and different traffic densities. We also show that our approach avoids the execution of unsafe actions and always maintains a safe distance from other vehicles. We construct an obstacle-at-corner scenario to show that the shared vision can help CAVs to observe obstacles earlier and take action to avoid traffic jams.

 - **Abstract**
 In many applications of Reinforcement Learning (RL), it is critically important that the algorithm performs safely, such that instantaneous hard constraints are satisfied at each step, and unsafe states and actions are avoided. However, existing algorithms for ''safe'' RL are often designed under constraints that either require expected cumulative costs to be bounded or assume all states are safe. Thus, such algorithms could violate instantaneous hard constraints and traverse unsafe states (and actions) in practice. Therefore, in this paper, we develop the first near-optimal safe RL algorithm for episodic Markov Decision Processes with unsafe states and actions under instantaneous hard constraints and the linear mixture model. It not only achieves a regret $\tilde{O}(\frac{d H^3 \sqrt{dK}}{\Delta_c})$ that tightly matches the state-of-the-art regret in the setting with only unsafe actions and nearly matches that in the unconstrained setting, but is also safe at each step, where $d$ is the feature-mapping dimension, $K$ is the number of episodes, $H$ is the number of steps in each episode, and $\Delta_c$ is a safety-related parameter. We also provide a lower bound $\tilde{\Omega}(\max\{dH \sqrt{K}, \frac{H}{\Delta_c^2}\})$, which indicates that the dependency on $\Delta_c$ is necessary. Further, both our algorithm design and regret analysis involve several novel ideas, which may be of independent interest.

 - **Abstract**
 The proliferation of smartphone devices has led to the emergence of powerful user services from enabling interactions with friends and business associates to mapping, finding nearby businesses and alerting users in real-time. Moreover, users do not realize that continuously sharing their trajectory data with online systems may end up revealing a great amount of information in terms of their behavior, mobility patterns and social relationships. Thus, addressing these privacy risks is a fundamental challenge. In this work, we present $TP^3$, a Privacy Protection system for Trajectory analytics. Our contributions are the following: (1) we model a new type of attack, namely 'social link exploitation attack', (2) we utilize the coresets theory, a fast and accurate technique which approximates well the original data using a small data set, and running queries on the coreset produces similar results to the original data, and (3) we employ the Serverless computing paradigm to accommodate a set of privacy operations for achieving high system performance with minimized provisioning costs, while preserving the users' privacy. We have developed these techniques in our $TP^3$ system that works with state-of-the-art trajectory analytics apps and applies different types of privacy operations. Our detailed experimental evaluation illustrates that our approach is both efficient and practical.

 - **Abstract**
 Autonomous UAV path planning for 3D reconstruction has been actively studied in various applications for high-quality 3D models. However, most existing works have adopted explore-then-exploit, prior-based or exploration-based strategies, demonstrating inefficiency with repeated flight and low autonomy. In this paper, we propose PredRecon, a prediction-boosted planning framework that can autonomously generate paths for high 3D reconstruction quality. We obtain inspiration from humans can roughly infer the complete construction structure from partial observation. Hence, we devise a surface prediction module (SPM) to predict the coarse complete surfaces of the target from the current partial reconstruction. Then, the uncovered surfaces are produced by online volumetric mapping waiting for observation by UAV. Lastly, a hierarchical planner plans motions for 3D reconstruction, which sequentially finds efficient global coverage paths, plans local paths for maximizing the performance of Multi-View Stereo (MVS), and generates smooth trajectories for image-pose pairs acquisition. We conduct benchmarks in the realistic simulator, which validates the performance of PredRecon compared with the classical and state-of-the-art methods. The open-source code is released at https://github.com/HKUST-Aerial-Robotics/PredRecon.

 - **Abstract**
 Sea surface height (SSH) is a key geophysical parameter for monitoring and studying meso-scale surface ocean dynamics. For several decades, the mapping of SSH products at regional and global scales has relied on nadir satellite altimeters, which provide one-dimensional-only along-track satellite observations of the SSH. The Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission deploys a new sensor that acquires for the first time wide-swath two-dimensional observations of the SSH. This provides new means to observe the ocean at previously unresolved spatial scales. A critical challenge for the exploiting of SWOT data is the separation of the SSH from other signals present in the observations. In this paper, we propose a novel learning-based approach for this SWOT calibration problem. It benefits from calibrated nadir altimetry products and a scale-space decomposition adapted to SWOT swath geometry and the structure of the different processes in play. In a supervised setting, our method reaches the state-of-the-art residual error of ~1.4cm while proposing a correction on the entire spectral from 10km to 1000k

 - **Abstract**
 Multivariate time series forecasting has been widely used in various practical scenarios. Recently, Transformer-based models have shown significant potential in forecasting tasks due to the capture of long-range dependencies. However, recent studies in the vision and NLP fields show that the role of attention modules is not clear, which can be replaced by other token aggregation operations. This paper investigates the contributions and deficiencies of attention mechanisms on the performance of time series forecasting. Specifically, we find that (1) attention is not necessary for capturing temporal dependencies, (2) the entanglement and redundancy in the capture of temporal and channel interaction affect the forecasting performance, and (3) it is important to model the mapping between the input and the prediction sequence. To this end, we propose MTS-Mixers, which use two factorized modules to capture temporal and channel dependencies. Experimental results on several real-world datasets show that MTS-Mixers outperform existing Transformer-based models with higher efficiency.

 - **Abstract**
 Deriving robust control policies for realistic urban navigation scenarios is not a trivial task. In an end-to-end approach, these policies must map high-dimensional images from the vehicle's cameras to low-level actions such as steering and throttle. While pure Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches are based exclusively on rewards,Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL) agents learn from expert demonstrations while interacting with the environment, which favors GAIL on tasks for which a reward signal is difficult to derive. In this work, the hGAIL architecture was proposed to solve the autonomous navigation of a vehicle in an end-to-end approach, mapping sensory perceptions directly to low-level actions, while simultaneously learning mid-level input representations of the agent's environment. The proposed hGAIL consists of an hierarchical Adversarial Imitation Learning architecture composed of two main modules: the GAN (Generative Adversarial Nets) which generates the Bird's-Eye View (BEV) representation mainly from the images of three frontal cameras of the vehicle, and the GAIL which learns to control the vehicle based mainly on the BEV predictions from the GAN as input.Our experiments have shown that GAIL exclusively from cameras (without BEV) fails to even learn the task, while hGAIL, after training, was able to autonomously navigate successfully in all intersections of the city.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.04657
 - **Abstract**
 The use of high order fully implicit Runge-Kutta methods is of significant importance in the context of the numerical solution of transient partial differential equations, in particular when solving large scale problems due to fine space resolution with many millions of spatial degrees of freedom and long time intervals. In this study we consider strongly A-stable implicit Runge-Kutta methods of arbitrary order of accuracy, based on Radau quadratures, for which efficient preconditioners have been introduced. A refined spectral analysis of the corresponding matrices and matrix-sequences is presented, both in terms of localization and asymptotic global distribution of the eigenvalues. Specific expressions of the eigenvectors are also obtained. The given study fully agrees with the numerically observed spectral behavior and substantially improves the theoretical studies done in this direction so far. Concluding remarks and open problems end the current work, with specific attention to the potential generalizations of the hereby suggested general approach.

 - **Abstract**
 Given the prevalence of 3D medical imaging technologies such as MRI and CT that are widely used in diagnosing and treating diverse diseases, 3D segmentation is one of the fundamental tasks of medical image analysis. Recently, Transformer-based models have started to achieve state-of-the-art performances across many vision tasks, through pre-training on large-scale natural image benchmark datasets. While works on medical image analysis have also begun to explore Transformer-based models, there is currently no optimal strategy to effectively leverage pre-trained Transformers, primarily due to the difference in dimensionality between 2D natural images and 3D medical images. Existing solutions either split 3D images into 2D slices and predict each slice independently, thereby losing crucial depth-wise information, or modify the Transformer architecture to support 3D inputs without leveraging pre-trained weights. In this work, we use a simple yet effective weight inflation strategy to adapt pre-trained Transformers from 2D to 3D, retaining the benefit of both transfer learning and depth information. We further investigate the effectiveness of transfer from different pre-training sources and objectives. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performances across a broad range of 3D medical image datasets, and can become a standard strategy easily utilized by all work on Transformer-based models for 3D medical images, to maximize performance.

 - **Abstract**
 Financial sector and especially the insurance industry collect vast volumes of text on a daily basis and through multiple channels (their agents, customer care centers, emails, social networks, and web in general). The information collected includes policies, expert and health reports, claims and complaints, results of surveys, and relevant social media posts. It is difficult to effectively extract label, classify, and interpret the essential information from such varied and unstructured material. Therefore, the Insurance Industry is among the ones that can benefit from applying technologies for the intelligent analysis of free text through Natural Language Processing (NLP). In this paper, CRL+, a novel text classification model combining Contrastive Representation Learning (CRL) and Active Learning is proposed to handle the challenge of using semi-supervised learning for text classification. In this method, supervised (CRL) is used to train a RoBERTa transformer model to encode the textual data into a contrastive representation space and then classify using a classification layer. This (CRL)-based transformer model is used as the base model in the proposed Active Learning mechanism to classify all the data in an iterative manner. The proposed model is evaluated using unstructured obituary data with objective to determine the cause of the death from the data. This model is compared with the CRL model and an Active Learning model with the RoBERTa base model. The experiment shows that the proposed method can outperform both methods for this specific task.

 - **Abstract**
 As transformer architectures become increasingly prevalent in computer vision, it is critical to understand their fairness implications. We perform the first study of the fairness of transformers applied to computer vision and benchmark several bias mitigation approaches from prior work. We visualize the feature space of the transformer self-attention modules and discover that a significant portion of the bias is encoded in the query matrix. With this knowledge, we propose TADeT, a targeted alignment strategy for debiasing transformers that aims to discover and remove bias primarily from query matrix features. We measure performance using Balanced Accuracy and Standard Accuracy, and fairness using Equalized Odds and Balanced Accuracy Difference. TADeT consistently leads to improved fairness over prior work on multiple attribute prediction tasks on the CelebA dataset, without compromising performance.

 - **Abstract**
 Sentiment analysis AKA opinion mining is one of the most widely used NLP applications to identify human intentions from their reviews. In the education sector, opinion mining is used to listen to student opinions and enhance their learning-teaching practices pedagogically. With advancements in sentiment annotation techniques and AI methodologies, student comments can be labelled with their sentiment orientation without much human intervention. In this review article, (1) we consider the role of emotional analysis in education from four levels: document level, sentence level, entity level, and aspect level, (2) sentiment annotation techniques including lexicon-based and corpus-based approaches for unsupervised annotations are explored, (3) the role of AI in sentiment analysis with methodologies like machine learning, deep learning, and transformers are discussed, (4) the impact of sentiment analysis on educational procedures to enhance pedagogy, decision-making, and evaluation are presented. Educational institutions have been widely invested to build sentiment analysis tools and process their student feedback to draw their opinions and insights. Applications built on sentiment analysis of student feedback are reviewed in this study. Challenges in sentiment analysis like multi-polarity, polysemous, negation words, and opinion spam detection are explored and their trends in the research space are discussed. The future directions of sentiment analysis in education are discussed.

 - **Abstract**
 Many open-domain dialogue systems rely on multiple response generators, any of which can contribute a response to the dialogue in a particular context. Thus the ability to compare potential responses and then select the best plays an important role in ensuring a dialogue system is coherent and engaging. Dialogue coherence goes beyond simply remaining on topic -- some trivia may be on topic and engaging when mentioned out of the blue, but may not be coherent and grounded in the context of the conversation. We carry out experiments on response selection in the Athena system, an Alexa Prize SocialBot that has dedicated content and multiple topic-specific response generators for a large number of topics. First, we collect a corpus of Athena conversations with live human traffic, where potential responses from all enabled response generators are logged and subsequently annotated for response quality. We compare several off-the-shelf response ranking methods for open-domain dialogue to Athena-Heuristic, a heuristic response ranker that was field-tested in Athena during the third Alexa Prize competition. We also compare these to a transformer-based response ranker we call Athena-RR, that we train on our Athena conversations. Athena-RR uses both the conversational context and the dialogue state to rank the potential responses. We find that Athena-RR with a Recall@1 of 70.79\% outperforms Athena-Heuristic and all of the off-the-shelf rankers by a large margin. We then conduct a live A/B study comparing Athena-Heuristic to Athena-RR in a 6,358 conversations with Alexa users. We show that Athena-RR leads to significantly longer conversations that receive significantly higher user ratings than the heuristic rule-based ranker.
### GFM: Building Geospatial Foundation Models via Continual Pretraining

 - **Abstract**
 Geospatial technologies are becoming increasingly essential in our world for a large range of tasks, such as earth monitoring and natural disaster response. To help improve the applicability and performance of deep learning models on these geospatial tasks, various works have pursued the idea of a geospatial foundation model, i.e., training networks from scratch on a large corpus of remote sensing imagery. However, this approach often requires a significant amount of data and training time to achieve suitable performance, especially when employing large state-of-the-art transformer models. In light of these challenges, we investigate a sustainable approach to building geospatial foundation models. In our investigations, we discover two important factors in the process. First, we find that the selection of pretraining data matters, even within the geospatial domain. We therefore gather a concise yet effective dataset for pretraining. Second, we find that available pretrained models on diverse datasets like ImageNet-22k should not be ignored when building geospatial foundation models, as their representations are still surprisingly effective. Rather, by leveraging their representations, we can build strong models for geospatial applications in a sustainable manner. To this end, we formulate a multi-objective continual pretraining approach for training sustainable geospatial foundation models. We experiment on a wide variety of downstream datasets and tasks, achieving strong performance across the board in comparison to ImageNet baselines and state-of-the-art geospatial pretrained models.

Experimental results on several real-world datasets show that MTS-Mixers outperform existing Transformer-based models with higher efficiency.

 - **Abstract**
 The Covid-19 pandemic had an enormous effect on our lives, especially on people's interactions. By introducing Covid-19 vaccines, both positive and negative opinions were raised over the subject of taking vaccines or not. In this paper, using data gathered from Twitter, including tweets and user profiles, we offer a comprehensive analysis of public opinion in Iran about the Coronavirus vaccines. For this purpose, we applied a search query technique combined with a topic modeling approach to extract vaccine-related tweets. We utilized transformer-based models to classify the content of the tweets and extract themes revolving around vaccination. We also conducted an emotion analysis to evaluate the public happiness and anger around this topic. Our results demonstrate that Covid-19 vaccination has attracted considerable attention from different angles, such as governmental issues, safety or hesitancy, and side effects. Moreover, Coronavirus-relevant phenomena like public vaccination and the rate of infection deeply impacted public emotional status and users' interactions.

 - **Abstract**
 As part of its digitization initiative, the German Central Bank (Deutsche Bundesbank) wants to examine the extent to which natural Language Processing (NLP) can be used to make independent decisions upon the eligibility criteria of securities prospectuses. Every month, the Directorate General Markets at the German Central Bank receives hundreds of scanned prospectuses in PDF format, which must be manually processed to decide upon their eligibility. We found that this tedious and time-consuming process can be (semi-)automated by employing modern NLP model architectures, which learn the linguistic feature representation in text to identify the present eligible and ineligible criteria. The proposed Decision Support System provides decisions of document-level eligibility criteria accompanied by human-understandable explanations of the decisions. The aim of this project is to model the described use case and to evaluate the extent to which current research results from the field of NLP can be applied to this problem. After creating a heterogeneous domain-specific dataset containing annotations of eligible and non-eligible mentions of relevant criteria, we were able to successfully build, train and deploy a semi-automatic decider model. This model is based on transformer-based language models and decision trees, which integrate the established rule-based parts of the decision processes. Results suggest that it is possible to efficiently model the problem and automate decision making to more than 90% for many of the considered eligibility criteria.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.04580
 - **Abstract**
 Writing a survey paper on one research topic usually needs to cover the salient content from numerous related papers, which can be modeled as a multi-document summarization (MDS) task. Existing MDS datasets usually focus on producing the structureless summary covering a few input documents. Meanwhile, previous structured summary generation works focus on summarizing a single document into a multi-section summary. These existing datasets and methods cannot meet the requirements of summarizing numerous academic papers into a structured summary. To deal with the scarcity of available data, we propose BigSurvey, the first large-scale dataset for generating comprehensive summaries of numerous academic papers on each topic. We collect target summaries from more than seven thousand survey papers and utilize their 430 thousand reference papers' abstracts as input documents. To organize the diverse content from dozens of input documents and ensure the efficiency of processing long text sequences, we propose a summarization method named category-based alignment and sparse transformer (CAST). The experimental results show that our CAST method outperforms various advanced summarization methods.

 - **Abstract**
 Specialised pre-trained language models are becoming more frequent in NLP since they can potentially outperform models trained on generic texts. BioBERT and BioClinicalBERT are two examples of such models that have shown promise in medical NLP tasks. Many of these models are overparametrised and resource-intensive, but thanks to techniques like Knowledge Distillation (KD), it is possible to create smaller versions that perform almost as well as their larger counterparts. In this work, we specifically focus on development of compact language models for processing clinical texts (i.e. progress notes, discharge summaries etc). We developed a number of efficient lightweight clinical transformers using knowledge distillation and continual learning, with the number of parameters ranging from 15 million to 65 million. These models performed comparably to larger models such as BioBERT and ClinicalBioBERT and significantly outperformed other compact models trained on general or biomedical data. Our extensive evaluation was done across several standard datasets and covered a wide range of clinical text-mining tasks, including Natural Language Inference, Relation Extraction, Named Entity Recognition, and Sequence Classification. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive study specifically focused on creating efficient and compact transformers for clinical NLP tasks. The models and code used in this study can be found on our Huggingface profile at https://huggingface.co/nlpie and Github page at https://github.com/nlpie-research/Lightweight-Clinical-Transformers, respectively, promoting reproducibility of our results.

 - **Abstract**
 HybrIK relies on a combination of analytical inverse kinematics and deep learning to produce more accurate 3D pose estimation from 2D monocular images. HybrIK has three major components: (1) pretrained convolution backbone, (2) deconvolution to lift 3D pose from 2D convolution features, (3) analytical inverse kinematics pass correcting deep learning prediction using learned distribution of plausible twist and swing angles. In this paper we propose an enhancement of the 2D to 3D lifting module, replacing deconvolution with Transformer, resulting in accuracy and computational efficiency improvement relative to the original HybrIK method. We demonstrate our results on commonly used H36M, PW3D, COCO and HP3D datasets. Our code is publicly available https://github.com/boreshkinai/hybrik-transformer.

 - **Abstract**
 Lithium metal battery (LMB) has the potential to be the next-generation battery system because of their high theoretical energy density. However, defects known as dendrites are formed by heterogeneous lithium (Li) plating, which hinder the development and utilization of LMBs. Non-destructive techniques to observe the dendrite morphology often use computerized X-ray tomography (XCT) imaging to provide cross-sectional views. To retrieve three-dimensional structures inside a battery, image segmentation becomes essential to quantitatively analyze XCT images. This work proposes a new binary semantic segmentation approach using a transformer-based neural network (T-Net) model capable of segmenting out dendrites from XCT data. In addition, we compare the performance of the proposed T-Net with three other algorithms, such as U-Net, Y-Net, and E-Net, consisting of an Ensemble Network model for XCT analysis. Our results show the advantages of using T-Net in terms of object metrics, such as mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) and mean Dice Similarity Coefficient (mDSC) as well as qualitatively through several comparative visualizations.

 We present Reversible Vision Transformers, a memory efficient architecture design for visual recognition. By decoupling the GPU memory requirement from the depth of the model, Reversible Vision Transformers enable scaling up architectures with efficient memory usage. We adapt two popular models, namely Vision Transformer and Multiscale Vision Transformers, to reversible variants and benchmark extensively across both model sizes and tasks of image classification, object detection and video classification. Reversible Vision Transformers achieve a reduced memory footprint of up to 15.5x at roughly identical model complexity, parameters and accuracy, demonstrating the promise of reversible vision transformers as an efficient backbone for hardware resource limited training regimes. Finally, we find that the additional computational burden of recomputing activations is more than overcome for deeper models, where throughput can increase up to 2.3x over their non-reversible counterparts.

 Nowadays, machine learning plays a key role in developing plenty of applications, e.g., smart homes, smart medical assistance, and autonomous driving. A major challenge of these applications is preserving high quality of the training and the serving data. Nevertheless, existing data cleaning methods cannot exploit context information. Thus, they usually fail to track shifts in the data distributions or the associated error profiles. To overcome these limitations, we introduce, in this paper, a novel method for automated tabular data cleaning powered by dynamic functional dependency rules extracted from a live context model. As a proof of concept, we create a smart home use case to collect data while preserving the context information. Using two different data sets, our evaluations show that the proposed cleaning method outperforms a set of baseline methods in terms of the detection and repair accuracy.

 - **Abstract**
 Sim2Real domain adaptation (DA) research focuses on the constrained setting of adapting from a labeled synthetic source domain to an unlabeled or sparsely labeled real target domain. However, for high-stakes applications (e.g. autonomous driving), it is common to have a modest amount of human-labeled real data in addition to plentiful auto-labeled source data (e.g. from a driving simulator). We study this setting of supervised sim2real DA applied to 2D object detection. We propose Domain Translation via Conditional Alignment and Reweighting (CARE) a novel algorithm that systematically exploits target labels to explicitly close the sim2real appearance and content gaps. We present an analytical justification of our algorithm and demonstrate strong gains over competing methods on standard benchmarks.
