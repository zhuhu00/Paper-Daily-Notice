 - **Abstract**
 Traditional SLAM algorithms are typically based on artificial features, which lack high-level information. By introducing semantic information, SLAM can own higher stability and robustness rather than purely hand-crafted features. However, the high uncertainty of semantic detection networks prohibits the practical functionality of high-level information. To solve the uncertainty property introduced by semantics, this paper proposed a novel probability map based on the Gaussian distribution assumption. This map transforms the semantic binary object detection into probability results, which help establish a probabilistic data association between artificial features and semantic info. Through our algorithm, the higher confidence will be given higher weights in each update step while the edge of the detection area will be endowed with lower confidence. Then the uncertainty is undermined and has less effect on nonlinear optimization. The experiments are carried out in the TUM RGBD dataset, results show that our system improves ORB-SLAM2 by about 15% in indoor environments' errors. We have demonstrated that the method can be successfully applied to environments containing dynamic objects.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper focuses on efficient landmark management in radar based simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). Landmark management is necessary in order to maintain a consistent map of the estimated landmarks relative to the estimate of the platform's pose. This task is particularly important when faced with multiple detections from the same landmark and/or dynamic environments where the location of a landmark can change. A further challenge with radar data is the presence of false detections. Accordingly, we propose a simple yet efficient rule based solution for radar SLAM landmark management. Assuming a low-dynamic environment, there are several steps in our solution: new landmarks need to be detected and included, false landmarks need to be identified and removed, and the consistency of the landmarks registered in the map needs to be maintained. To illustrate our solution, we run an extended Kalman filter SLAM algorithm in an environment containing both stationary and temporally stationary landmarks. Our simulation results demonstrate that the proposed solution is capable of reliably managing landmarks even when faced with false detections and multiple detections from the same landmark.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.07121
 - **Abstract**
 Reliable point cloud data is essential for perception tasks \textit{e.g.} in robotics and autonomous driving applications. Adverse weather causes a specific type of noise to light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensor data, which degrades the quality of the point clouds significantly. To address this issue, this letter presents a novel point cloud adverse weather denoising deep learning algorithm (4DenoiseNet). Our algorithm takes advantage of the time dimension unlike deep learning adverse weather denoising methods in the literature. It performs about 10\% better in terms of intersection over union metric compared to the previous work and is more computationally efficient. These results are achieved on our novel SnowyKITTI dataset, which has over 40000 adverse weather annotated point clouds. Moreover, strong qualitative results on the Canadian Adverse Driving Conditions dataset indicate good generalizability to domain shifts and to different sensor intrinsics.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.07350
 - **Abstract**
 In this letter, we address blockage detection and precoder design for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) links, without communication overhead required. Blockage detection is achieved by classifying light detection and ranging (LIDAR) data through a physics-based graph neural network (GNN). For precoder design, a preliminary channel estimate is obtained by running ray tracing on a 3D surface obtained from LIDAR data. This estimate is successively refined and the precoder is designed accordingly. Numerical simulations show that blockage detection is successful with 95% accuracy. Our digital precoding achieves 90% of the capacity and analog precoding outperforms previous works exploiting LIDAR for precoder design.

 - **Abstract**
 Promising complementarity exists between the texture features of color images and the geometric information of LiDAR point clouds. However, there still present many challenges for efficient and robust feature fusion in the field of 3D object detection. In this paper, first, unstructured 3D point clouds are filled in the 2D plane and 3D point cloud features are extracted faster using projection-aware convolution layers. Further, the corresponding indexes between different sensor signals are established in advance in the data preprocessing, which enables faster cross-modal feature fusion. To address LiDAR points and image pixels misalignment problems, two new plug-and-play fusion modules, LiCamFuse and BiLiCamFuse, are proposed. In LiCamFuse, soft query weights with perceiving the Euclidean distance of bimodal features are proposed. In BiLiCamFuse, the fusion module with dual attention is proposed to deeply correlate the geometric and textural features of the scene. The quantitative results on the KITTI dataset demonstrate that the proposed method achieves better feature-level fusion. In addition, the proposed network shows a shorter running time compared to existing methods.

 - **Abstract**
 Generative models (e.g., GANs and diffusion models) learn the underlying data distribution in an unsupervised manner. However, many applications of interest require sampling from a specific region of the generative model's output space or evenly over a range of characteristics. To allow efficient sampling in these scenarios, we propose Generative Visual Prompt (PromptGen), a framework for distributional control over pre-trained generative models by incorporating knowledge of arbitrary off-the-shelf models. PromptGen defines control as an energy-based model (EBM) and samples images in a feed-forward manner by approximating the EBM with invertible neural networks, avoiding optimization at inference. We demonstrate how PromptGen can control several generative models (e.g., StyleGAN2, StyleNeRF, diffusion autoencoder, and NVAE) using various off-the-shelf models: (1) with the CLIP model, PromptGen can sample images guided by text, (2) with image classifiers, PromptGen can de-bias generative models across a set of attributes, and (3) with inverse graphics models, PromptGen can sample images of the same identity in different poses. (4) Finally, PromptGen reveals that the CLIP model shows "reporting bias" when used as control, and PromptGen can further de-bias this controlled distribution in an iterative manner. Our code is available at https://github.com/ChenWu98/Generative-Visual-Prompt.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.06952
 - **Abstract**
 This study proposed a deep learning-based tracking method for ultrasound (US) image-guided radiation therapy. The proposed cascade deep learning model is composed of an attention network, a mask region-based convolutional neural network (mask R-CNN), and a long short-term memory (LSTM) network. The attention network learns a mapping from a US image to a suspected area of landmark motion in order to reduce the search region. The mask R-CNN then produces multiple region-of-interest (ROI) proposals in the reduced region and identifies the proposed landmark via three network heads: bounding box regression, proposal classification, and landmark segmentation. The LSTM network models the temporal relationship among the successive image frames for bounding box regression and proposal classification. To consolidate the final proposal, a selection method is designed according to the similarities between sequential frames. The proposed method was tested on the liver US tracking datasets used in the Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Interventions (MICCAI) 2015 challenges, where the landmarks were annotated by three experienced observers to obtain their mean positions. Five-fold cross-validation on the 24 given US sequences with ground truths shows that the mean tracking error for all landmarks is 0.65+/-0.56 mm, and the errors of all landmarks are within 2 mm. We further tested the proposed model on 69 landmarks from the testing dataset that has a similar image pattern to the training pattern, resulting in a mean tracking error of 0.94+/-0.83 mm. Our experimental results have demonstrated the feasibility and accuracy of our proposed method in tracking liver anatomic landmarks using US images, providing a potential solution for real-time liver tracking for active motion management during radiation therapy.

 - **Abstract**
 In recent years, face recognition systems have achieved exceptional success due to promising advances in deep learning architectures. However, they still fail to achieve expected accuracy when matching profile images against a gallery of frontal images. Current approaches either perform pose normalization (i.e., frontalization) or disentangle pose information for face recognition. We instead propose a new approach to utilize pose as an auxiliary information via an attention mechanism. In this paper, we hypothesize that pose attended information using an attention mechanism can guide contextual and distinctive feature extraction from profile faces, which further benefits a better representation learning in an embedded domain. To achieve this, first, we design a unified coupled profile-to-frontal face recognition network. It learns the mapping from faces to a compact embedding subspace via a class-specific contrastive loss. Second, we develop a novel pose attention block (PAB) to specially guide the pose-agnostic feature extraction from profile faces. To be more specific, PAB is designed to explicitly help the network to focus on important features along both channel and spatial dimension while learning discriminative yet pose invariant features in an embedding subspace. To validate the effectiveness of our proposed method, we conduct experiments on both controlled and in the wild benchmarks including Multi-PIE, CFP, IJBC, and show superiority over the state of the arts.

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07070
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.07070
 - **Abstract**
 This paper proposes a family of network centralities called fixed-point centralities. This centrality family is defined via the fixed point of permutation equivariant mappings related to the underlying network. Such a centrality notion is immediately extended to define fixed-point centralities for infinite graphs characterized by graphons. Variation bounds of such centralities with respect to the variations of the underlying graphs and graphons under mild assumptions are established. Fixed-point centralities connect with a variety of different models on networks including graph neural networks, static and dynamic games on networks, and Markov decision processes.

 - **Abstract**
 Assuring safety of automated vehicles (SAE Level 3+) requires specifying and validating the behavior of such a vehicle in its operational environment. In order to argue and support assumptions that are made during the behavior specification within scenarios, a traceable documentation of design decisions is required. With the introduction of the \textit{semantic norm behavior analysis} a method is proposed, which contributes to a traceable mapping of concerns towards the behavior of an automated vehicle in its operational environment to a formal rule system of semantic concepts for considered scenarios. In this work, a semantic norm behavior analysis is conducted in two selected example scenarios. Thereby, an example of the formalization of behavioral rules from an excerpt of the German traffic code is given. -- Die Absicherung automatisierter Stra{\ss}enfahrzeuge (SAE Level 3+) setzt die Spezifikation und \"Uberpr\"ufung des Verhaltens eines Fahrzeugs in seiner Betriebsumgebung voraus. Um Annahmen, welche bei der Verhaltensspezifikation innerhalb von Szenarien getroffen werden, begr\"unden und belegen zu k\"onnen, ist eine durchg\"angige Dokumentation dieser Entwurfsentscheidungen erforderlich. Mit der Einf\"uhrung der \textit{semantischen Normverhaltensanalyse} wird eine Methode vorgeschlagen, mithilfe derer Anspr\"uche an das Verhalten eines automatisierten Fahrzeugs in seiner Betriebsumgebung durchg\"angig auf ein formales Regelsystem aus semantischen Konzepten f\"ur ausgew\"ahlte Szenarien abgebildet werden k\"onnen. Eine semantische Normverhaltensanalyse wird in dieser Arbeit in zwei ausgew\"ahlten Szenarien durchgef\"uhrt. Hierf\"ur werden Verhaltensregeln aus einem Auszug der Stra{\ss}enverkehrsordnung exemplarisch formalisiert.

 - **Abstract**
 The United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) challenge the global community to build a world where no one is left behind. Recognizing that research plays a fundamental part in supporting these goals, attempts have been made to classify research publications according to their relevance in supporting each of the UN's SDGs. In this paper, we outline the methodology that we followed when mapping research articles to SDGs and which is adopted by Times Higher Education in their Social Impact rankings. We also discuss various aspects in which the methodology can be improved and generalized to other types of content apart from research articles. The results presented in this paper are the outcome of the SDG Research Mapping Initiative that was established as a partnership between the University of Southern Denmark, the Aurora European Universities Alliance (represented by Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam), the University of Auckland, and Elsevier to bring together broad expertise and share best practices on identifying research contributions to UN's Sustainable Development Goals.

 - **Abstract**
 Many computational problems can be formulated in terms of high-dimensional functions. Simple representations of such functions and resulting computations with them typically suffer from the "curse of dimensionality", an exponential cost dependence on dimension. Tensor networks provide a way to represent certain classes of high-dimensional functions with polynomial memory. This results in computations where the exponential cost is ameliorated or in some cases, removed, if the tensor network representation can be obtained. Here, we introduce a direct mapping from the arithmetic circuit of a function to arithmetic circuit tensor networks, avoiding the need to perform any optimization or functional fit. We demonstrate the power of the circuit construction in examples of multivariable integration on the unit hypercube in up to 50 dimensions, where the complexity of integration can be understood from the circuit structure. We find very favorable cost scaling compared to quasi-Monte-Carlo integration for these cases, and further give an example where efficient quasi-Monte-Carlo cannot be theoretically performed without knowledge of the underlying tensor network circuit structure.

 - **Abstract**
 The optimal operation of regulated lakes is a challenging task involving conflicting objectives, ranging from controlling lake levels to avoid floods and low levels to water supply downstream. The traditional approach to operation policy design is based on an offline optimization, where a feedback control rule mapping lake storage into daily release decisions is identified over a set of observational data. In this paper, we propose a receding-horizon policy for a more frequent, online regulation of the lake level, and we discuss its tuning as compared to benchmark approaches. As side contributions, we provide a daily alternative based on the same rationale, and we show that this is still valid under some assumptions on the water inflow. Numerical simulations are used to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach. We demonstrate the approach on the regulated lake Como, Italy.

 - **Abstract**
 Automatic depression detection on Twitter can help individuals privately and conveniently understand their mental health status in the early stages before seeing mental health professionals. Most existing black-box-like deep learning methods for depression detection largely focused on improving classification performance. However, explaining model decisions is imperative in health research because decision-making can often be high-stakes and life-and-death. Reliable automatic diagnosis of mental health problems including depression should be supported by credible explanations justifying models' predictions. In this work, we propose a novel explainable model for depression detection on Twitter. It comprises a novel encoder combining hierarchical attention mechanisms and feed-forward neural networks. To support psycholinguistic studies, our model leverages metaphorical concept mappings as input. Thus, it not only detects depressed individuals, but also identifies features of such users' tweets and associated metaphor concept mappings.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.07507
 - **Abstract**
 In offline model-based optimization, we strive to maximize a black-box objective function by only leveraging a static dataset of designs and their scores. This problem setting arises in numerous fields including the design of materials, robots, DNA sequences, and proteins. Recent approaches train a deep neural network (DNN) on the static dataset to act as a proxy function, and then perform gradient ascent on the existing designs to obtain potentially high-scoring designs. This methodology frequently suffers from the out-of-distribution problem where the proxy function often returns poor designs. To mitigate this problem, we propose BiDirectional learning for offline Infinite-width model-based optimization} (BDI). BDI consists of two mappings: the forward mapping leverages the static dataset to predict the scores of the high-scoring designs, and the backward mapping leverages the high-scoring designs to predict the scores of the static dataset. The backward mapping, neglected in previous work, can distill more information from the static dataset into the high-scoring designs, which effectively mitigates the out-of-distribution problem. For a finite-width DNN model, the loss function of the backward mapping is intractable and only has an approximate form, which leads to a significant deterioration of the design quality. We thus adopt an infinite-width DNN model, and propose to employ the corresponding neural tangent kernel to yield a closed-form loss for more accurate design updates. Experiments on {various} tasks verify the effectiveness of BDI. The code is available at https://github.com/GGchen1997/BDI.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.06953
 - **Abstract**
 In recent years novel architecture components for image classification have been developed, starting with attention and patches used in transformers. While prior works have analyzed the influence of some aspects of architecture components on the robustness to adversarial attacks, in particular for vision transformers, the understanding of the main factors is still limited. We compare several (non)-robust classifiers with different architectures and study their properties, including the effect of adversarial training on the interpretability of the learnt features and robustness to unseen threat models. An ablation from ResNet to ConvNeXt reveals key architectural changes leading to almost $10\%$ higher $\ell_\infty$-robustness.

 - **Abstract**
 The exponentially growing model size drives the continued success of deep learning, but it brings prohibitive computation and memory cost. From the algorithm perspective, model sparsification and quantization have been studied to alleviate the problem. From the architecture perspective, hardware vendors provide Tensor cores for acceleration. However, it is very challenging to gain practical speedups from sparse, low-precision matrix operations on Tensor cores, because of the strict requirements for data layout and lack of support for efficiently manipulating the low-precision integers. We propose Magicube, a high-performance sparse-matrix library for low-precision integers on Tensor cores. Magicube supports SpMM and SDDMM, two major sparse operations in deep learning with mixed precision. Experimental results on an NVIDIA A100 GPU show that Magicube achieves on average 1.44x (up to 2.37x) speedup over the vendor-optimized library for sparse kernels, and 1.43x speedup over the state-of-the-art with a comparable accuracy for end-to-end sparse Transformer inference.

 - **Abstract**
 Lane detection is one of the fundamental modules in self-driving. In this paper we employ a transformer-only method for lane detection, thus it could benefit from the blooming development of fully vision transformer and achieves the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on both CULane and TuSimple benchmarks, by fine-tuning the weight fully pre-trained on large datasets. More importantly, this paper proposes a novel and general framework called PriorLane, which is used to enhance the segmentation performance of the fully vision transformer by introducing the low-cost local prior knowledge. PriorLane utilizes an encoder-only transformer to fuse the feature extracted by a pre-trained segmentation model with prior knowledge embeddings. Note that a Knowledge Embedding Alignment (KEA) module is adapted to enhance the fusion performance by aligning the knowledge embedding. Extensive experiments on our Zjlab dataset show that Prior-Lane outperforms SOTA lane detection methods by a 2.82% mIoU, and the code will be released at: https://github. com/vincentqqb/PriorLane.

 - **Abstract**
 Vision Transformers (ViTs) have proven to be effective, in solving 2D image understanding tasks by training over large-scale image datasets; and meanwhile as a somehow separate track, in modeling the 3D visual world too such as voxels or point clouds. However, with the growing hope that transformers can become the "universal" modeling tool for heterogeneous data, ViTs for 2D and 3D tasks have so far adopted vastly different architecture designs that are hardly transferable. That invites an (over-)ambitious question: can we close the gap between the 2D and 3D ViT architectures? As a piloting study, this paper demonstrates the appealing promise to understand the 3D visual world, using a standard 2D ViT architecture, with only minimal customization at the input and output levels without redesigning the pipeline. To build a 3D ViT from its 2D sibling, we "inflate" the patch embedding and token sequence, accompanied with new positional encoding mechanisms designed to match the 3D data geometry. The resultant "minimalist" 3D ViT, named Simple3D-Former, performs surprisingly robustly on popular 3D tasks such as object classification, point cloud segmentation and indoor scene detection, compared to highly customized 3D-specific designs. It can hence act as a strong baseline for new 3D ViTs. Moreover, we note that pursing a unified 2D-3D ViT design has practical relevance besides just scientific curiosity. Specifically, we demonstrate that Simple3D-Former naturally enables to exploit the wealth of pre-trained weights from large-scale realistic 2D images (e.g., ImageNet), which can be plugged in to enhancing the 3D task performance "for free".

 - **Abstract**
 Android developers frequently update source code to improve the performance, security, or maintainability of Android apps. Such Android code updating activities are intuitively repetitive, manual, and time-consuming. In this paper, we propose AutoUpdate, a Transformer-based automated code update recommendation approach for Android Apps, which takes advantage of code abstraction (Abs) and Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) techniques to represent source code. Since this is the first work to automatically update code in Android apps, we collect a history of 209,346 updated method pairs from 3,195 real-world Android applications available on Google Play stores that span 14 years (2008-2022). Through an extensive experiment on our curated datasets, the results show that AutoUpdate(1) achieves a perfect prediction of 25% based on the realistic time-wise evaluation scenario, which outperforms the two baseline approaches; (2) gains benefits at least 17% of improvement by using both Abs and BPE; (3) is able to recommend code updates for various purposes (e.g., fixing bugs, adding new feature, refactoring methods). On the other hand, the models (4) could produce optimistically high accuracy due to the unrealistic evaluation scenario (i.e., random splits), suggesting that researchers should consider time-wise evaluation scenarios in the future; (5) are less accurate for a larger size of methods with a larger number of changed tokens, providing a research opportunity for future work. Our findings demonstrate the significant advancement of NMT-based code update recommendation approaches for Android apps.

 - **Abstract**
 Medical vision-and-language pre-training provides a feasible solution to extract effective vision-and-language representations from medical images and texts. However, few studies have been dedicated to this field to facilitate medical vision-and-language understanding. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised learning paradigm with multi-modal masked autoencoders (M$^3$AE), which learn cross-modal domain knowledge by reconstructing missing pixels and tokens from randomly masked images and texts. There are three key designs to make this simple approach work. First, considering the different information densities of vision and language, we adopt different masking ratios for the input image and text, where a considerably larger masking ratio is used for images. Second, we use visual and textual features from different layers to perform the reconstruction to deal with different levels of abstraction in visual and language. Third, we develop different designs for vision and language decoders (i.e., a Transformer for vision and a multi-layer perceptron for language). To perform a comprehensive evaluation and facilitate further research, we construct a medical vision-and-language benchmark including three tasks. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, where state-of-the-art results are achieved on all downstream tasks. Besides, we conduct further analysis to better verify the effectiveness of different components of our approach and various settings of pre-training.

 - **Abstract**
 Generally, residual connections are indispensable network components in building CNNs and Transformers for various downstream tasks in CV and VL, which encourages skip shortcuts between network blocks. However, the layer-by-layer loopback residual connections may also hurt the model's robustness by allowing unsuspecting input. In this paper, we proposed a simple yet strong backdoor attack method - BadRes, where the residual connections play as a turnstile to be deterministic on clean inputs while unpredictable on poisoned ones. We have performed empirical evaluations on four datasets with ViT and BEiT models, and the BadRes achieves 97% attack success rate while receiving zero performance degradation on clean data. Moreover, we analyze BadRes with state-of-the-art defense methods and reveal the fundamental weakness lying in residual connections.

 - **Abstract**
 We propose Beat Transformer, a novel Transformer encoder architecture for joint beat and downbeat tracking. Different from previous models that track beats solely based on the spectrogram of an audio mixture, our model deals with demixed spectrograms with multiple instrument channels. This is inspired by the fact that humans perceive metrical structures from richer musical contexts, such as chord progression and instrumentation. To this end, we develop a Transformer model with both time-wise attention and instrument-wise attention to capture deep-buried metrical cues. Moreover, our model adopts a novel dilated self-attention mechanism, which achieves powerful hierarchical modelling with only linear complexity. Experiments demonstrate a significant improvement in demixed beat tracking over the non-demixed version. Also, Beat Transformer achieves up to 4% point improvement in downbeat tracking accuracy over the TCN architectures. We further discover an interpretable attention pattern that mirrors our understanding of hierarchical metrical structures.

 - **Abstract**
 Video prediction is an important yet challenging problem; burdened with the tasks of generating future frames and learning environment dynamics. Recently, autoregressive latent video models have proved to be a powerful video prediction tool, by separating the video prediction into two sub-problems: pre-training an image generator model, followed by learning an autoregressive prediction model in the latent space of the image generator. However, successfully generating high-fidelity and high-resolution videos has yet to be seen. In this work, we investigate how to train an autoregressive latent video prediction model capable of predicting high-fidelity future frames with minimal modification to existing models, and produce high-resolution (256x256) videos. Specifically, we scale up prior models by employing a high-fidelity image generator (VQ-GAN) with a causal transformer model, and introduce additional techniques of top-k sampling and data augmentation to further improve video prediction quality. Despite the simplicity, the proposed method achieves competitive performance to state-of-the-art approaches on standard video prediction benchmarks with fewer parameters, and enables high-resolution video prediction on complex and large-scale datasets.

 - **Abstract**
 Determining an appropriate number of attention heads on one hand and the number of transformer-encoders, on the other hand, is an important choice for Computer Vision (CV) tasks using the Transformer architecture. Computing experiments confirmed the expectation that the total number of parameters has to satisfy the condition of overdetermination (i.e., number of constraints significantly exceeding the number of parameters). Then, good generalization performance can be expected. This sets the boundaries within which the number of heads and the number of transformers can be chosen. If the role of context in images to be classified can be assumed to be small, it is favorable to use multiple transformers with a low number of heads (such as one or two). In classifying objects whose class may heavily depend on the context within the image (i.e., the meaning of a patch being dependent on other patches), the number of heads is equally important as that of transformers.

 - **Abstract**
 We describe the winning submission to the CRAC 2022 Shared Task on Multilingual Coreference Resolution. Our system first solves mention detection and then coreference linking on the retrieved spans with an antecedent-maximization approach, and both tasks are fine-tuned jointly with shared Transformer weights. We report results of fine-tuning a wide range of pretrained models. The center of this contribution are fine-tuned multilingual models. We found one large multilingual model with sufficiently large encoder to increase performance on all datasets across the board, with the benefit not limited only to the underrepresented languages or groups of typologically relative languages.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we ask whether Vision Transformers (ViTs) can serve as an underlying architecture for improving the adversarial robustness of machine learning models against evasion attacks. While earlier works have focused on improving Convolutional Neural Networks, we show that also ViTs are highly suitable for adversarial training to achieve competitive performance. We achieve this objective using a custom adversarial training recipe, discovered using rigorous ablation studies on a subset of the ImageNet dataset. The canonical training recipe for ViTs recommends strong data augmentation, in part to compensate for the lack of vision inductive bias of attention modules, when compared to convolutions. We show that this recipe achieves suboptimal performance when used for adversarial training. In contrast, we find that omitting all heavy data augmentation, and adding some additional bag-of-tricks ($\varepsilon$-warmup and larger weight decay), significantly boosts the performance of robust ViTs. We show that our recipe generalizes to different classes of ViT architectures and large-scale models on full ImageNet-1k. Additionally, investigating the reasons for the robustness of our models, we show that it is easier to generate strong attacks during training when using our recipe and that this leads to better robustness at test time. Finally, we further study one consequence of adversarial training by proposing a way to quantify the semantic nature of adversarial perturbations and highlight its correlation with the robustness of the model. Overall, we recommend that the community should avoid translating the canonical training recipes in ViTs to robust training and rethink common training choices in the context of adversarial training.

 - **Abstract**
 Pre-trained language models (PLMs) often take advantage of the monolingual and multilingual dataset that is freely available online to acquire general or mixed domain knowledge before deployment into specific tasks. Extra-large PLMs (xLPLMs) are proposed very recently to claim supreme performances over smaller-sized PLMs such as in machine translation (MT) tasks. These xLPLMs include Meta-AI's wmt21-dense-24-wide-en-X and NLLB. \textit{In this work, we examine if xLPLMs are absolutely superior to smaller-sized PLMs in fine-tuning toward domain-specific MTs.} We use two different in-domain data of different sizes: commercial automotive in-house data and \textbf{clinical} shared task data from the ClinSpEn2022 challenge at WMT2022. We choose popular Marian Helsinki as smaller sized PLM and two massive-sized Mega-Transformers from Meta-AI as xLPLMs. Our experimental investigation shows that 1) on smaller sized in-domain commercial automotive data, xLPLM wmt21-dense-24-wide-en-X indeed shows much better evaluation scores using S\textsc{acre}BLEU and hLEPOR metrics than smaller-sized Marian, even though its score increase rate is lower than Marian after fine-tuning; 2) on relatively larger-size well prepared clinical data fine-tuning, the xLPLM NLLB \textbf{tends to lose} its advantage over smaller-sized Marian on two sub-tasks (clinical terms and ontology concepts) using ClinSpEn offered metrics METEOR, COMET, and ROUGE-L, and totally lost to Marian on Task-1 (clinical cases) on all metrics including S\textsc{acre}BLEU and BLEU; 3) \textbf{metrics do not always agree} with each other on the same tasks using the same model outputs.
### On the Surprising Effectiveness of Transformers in Low-Labeled Video  Recognition

 - **Abstract**
 Recently vision transformers have been shown to be competitive with convolution-based methods (CNNs) broadly across multiple vision tasks. The less restrictive inductive bias of transformers endows greater representational capacity in comparison with CNNs. However, in the image classification setting this flexibility comes with a trade-off with respect to sample efficiency, where transformers require ImageNet-scale training. This notion has carried over to video where transformers have not yet been explored for video classification in the low-labeled or semi-supervised settings. Our work empirically explores the low data regime for video classification and discovers that, surprisingly, transformers perform extremely well in the low-labeled video setting compared to CNNs. We specifically evaluate video vision transformers across two contrasting video datasets (Kinetics-400 and SomethingSomething-V2) and perform thorough analysis and ablation studies to explain this observation using the predominant features of video transformer architectures. We even show that using just the labeled data, transformers significantly outperform complex semi-supervised CNN methods that leverage large-scale unlabeled data as well. Our experiments inform our recommendation that semi-supervised learning video work should consider the use of video transformers in the future.
### Hydra Attention: Efficient Attention with Many Heads

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.07484
 - **Abstract**
 While transformers have begun to dominate many tasks in vision, applying them to large images is still computationally difficult. A large reason for this is that self-attention scales quadratically with the number of tokens, which in turn, scales quadratically with the image size. On larger images (e.g., 1080p), over 60% of the total computation in the network is spent solely on creating and applying attention matrices. We take a step toward solving this issue by introducing Hydra Attention, an extremely efficient attention operation for Vision Transformers (ViTs). Paradoxically, this efficiency comes from taking multi-head attention to its extreme: by using as many attention heads as there are features, Hydra Attention is computationally linear in both tokens and features with no hidden constants, making it significantly faster than standard self-attention in an off-the-shelf ViT-B/16 by a factor of the token count. Moreover, Hydra Attention retains high accuracy on ImageNet and, in some cases, actually improves it.

 - **Abstract**
 Gastro-Intestinal Tract cancer is considered a fatal malignant condition of the organs in the GI tract. Due to its fatality, there is an urgent need for medical image segmentation techniques to segment organs to reduce the treatment time and enhance the treatment. Traditional segmentation techniques rely upon handcrafted features and are computationally expensive and inefficient. Vision Transformers have gained immense popularity in many image classification and segmentation tasks. To address this problem from a transformers' perspective, we introduced a hybrid CNN-transformer architecture to segment the different organs from an image. The proposed solution is robust, scalable, and computationally efficient, with a Dice and Jaccard coefficient of 0.79 and 0.72, respectively. The proposed solution also depicts the essence of deep learning-based automation to improve the effectiveness of the treatment

 - **Abstract**
 This paper presents OmniVL, a new foundation model to support both image-language and video-language tasks using one universal architecture. It adopts a unified transformer-based visual encoder for both image and video inputs, and thus can perform joint image-language and video-language pretraining. We demonstrate, for the first time, such a paradigm benefits both image and video tasks, as opposed to the conventional one-directional transfer (e.g., use image-language to help video-language). To this end, we propose a decoupled joint pretraining of image-language and video-language to effectively decompose the vision-language modeling into spatial and temporal dimensions and obtain performance boost on both image and video tasks. Moreover, we introduce a novel unified vision-language contrastive (UniVLC) loss to leverage image-text, video-text, image-label (e.g., image classification), video-label (e.g., video action recognition) data together, so that both supervised and noisily supervised pretraining data are utilized as much as possible. Without incurring extra task-specific adaptors, OmniVL can simultaneously support visual only tasks (e.g., image classification, video action recognition), cross-modal alignment tasks (e.g., image/video-text retrieval), and multi-modal understanding and generation tasks (e.g., image/video question answering, captioning). We evaluate OmniVL on a wide range of downstream tasks and achieve state-of-the-art or competitive results with similar model size and data scale.

 - **Abstract**
 Owing to resource limitations, efficient computation systems have long been a critical demand for those designing autonomous vehicles. Additionally, sensor cost and size restrict the development of self-driving cars. This paper presents an efficient framework for the operation of vision-based automatic vehicles; a front-facing camera and a few inexpensive radars are the required sensors for driving environment perception. The proposed algorithm comprises a multi-task UNet (MTUNet) network for extracting image features and constrained iterative linear quadratic regulator (CILQR) modules for rapid lateral and longitudinal motion planning. The MTUNet is designed to simultaneously solve lane line segmentation, ego vehicle heading angle regression, road type classification, and traffic object detection tasks at an approximate speed of 40 FPS when an RGB image of size 228 x 228 is fed into it. The CILQR algorithms then take processed MTUNet outputs and radar data as their input to produce driving commands for lateral and longitudinal vehicle automation guidance; both optimal control problems can be solved within 1 ms. The proposed CILQR controllers are shown to be more efficient than the sequential quadratic programming (SQP) methods and can collaborate with the MTUNet to drive a car autonomously in unseen simulation environments for lane-keeping and car-following maneuvers. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed autonomous driving system is applicable to modern automobiles.

 - **Abstract**
 Reliable point cloud data is essential for perception tasks \textit{e.g.} in robotics and autonomous driving applications. Adverse weather causes a specific type of noise to light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensor data, which degrades the quality of the point clouds significantly. To address this issue, this letter presents a novel point cloud adverse weather denoising deep learning algorithm (4DenoiseNet). Our algorithm takes advantage of the time dimension unlike deep learning adverse weather denoising methods in the literature. It performs about 10\% better in terms of intersection over union metric compared to the previous work and is more computationally efficient. These results are achieved on our novel SnowyKITTI dataset, which has over 40000 adverse weather annotated point clouds. Moreover, strong qualitative results on the Canadian Adverse Driving Conditions dataset indicate good generalizability to domain shifts and to different sensor intrinsics.
