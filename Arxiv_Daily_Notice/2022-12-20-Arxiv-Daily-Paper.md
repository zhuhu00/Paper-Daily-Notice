 - **Abstract**
 We present Mu$^{2}$SLAM, a multilingual sequence-to-sequence model pre-trained jointly on unlabeled speech, unlabeled text and supervised data spanning Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), Automatic Speech Translation (AST) and Machine Translation (MT), in over 100 languages. By leveraging a quantized representation of speech as a target, Mu$^{2}$SLAM trains the speech-text models with a sequence-to-sequence masked denoising objective similar to T5 on the decoder and a masked language modeling (MLM) objective on the encoder, for both unlabeled speech and text, while utilizing the supervised tasks to improve cross-lingual and cross-modal representation alignment within the model. On CoVoST AST, Mu$^{2}$SLAM establishes a new state-of-the-art for models trained on public datasets, improving on xx-en translation over the previous best by 1.9 BLEU points and on en-xx translation by 1.1 BLEU points. On Voxpopuli ASR, our model matches the performance of an mSLAM model fine-tuned with an RNN-T decoder, despite using a relatively weaker sequence-to-sequence architecture. On text understanding tasks, our model improves by more than 6\% over mSLAM on XNLI, getting closer to the performance of mT5 models of comparable capacity on XNLI and TydiQA, paving the way towards a single model for all speech and text understanding tasks.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper proposes a perception and path planning pipeline for autonomous racing in an unknown bounded course. The pipeline was initially created for the 2021 evGrandPrix autonomous division and was further improved for the 2022 event, both of which resulting in first place finishes. Using a simple LiDAR-based perception pipeline feeding into an occupancy grid based expansion algorithm, we determine a goal point to drive. This pipeline successfully achieved reliable and consistent laps in addition with occupancy grid algorithm to know the ways around a cone-defined track with an averaging speeds of 6.85 m/s over a distance 434.2 meters for a total lap time of 63.4 seconds.

 - **Abstract**
 Extracting building heights from satellite images is an active research area used in many fields such as telecommunications, city planning, etc. Many studies utilize DSM (Digital Surface Models) generated with lidars or stereo images for this purpose. Predicting the height of the buildings using only RGB images is challenging due to the insufficient amount of data, low data quality, variations of building types, different angles of light and shadow, etc. In this study, we present an instance segmentation-based building height extraction method to predict building masks with their respective heights from a single RGB satellite image. We used satellite images with building height annotations of certain cities along with an open-source satellite dataset with the transfer learning approach. We reached, the bounding box mAP 59, the mask mAP 52.6, and the average accuracy value of 70% for buildings belonging to each height class in our test set.

 - **Abstract**
 Segmentation of lidar data is a task that provides rich, point-wise information about the environment of robots or autonomous vehicles. Currently best performing neural networks for lidar segmentation are fine-tuned to specific datasets. Switching the lidar sensor without retraining on a big set of annotated data from the new sensor creates a domain shift, which causes the network performance to drop drastically. In this work we propose a new method for lidar domain adaption, in which we use annotated panoptic lidar datasets and recreate the recorded scenes in the structure of a different lidar sensor. We narrow the domain gap to the target data by recreating panoptic data from one domain in another and mixing the generated data with parts of (pseudo) labeled target domain data. Our method improves the nuScenes to SemanticKITTI unsupervised domain adaptation performance by 15.2 mean Intersection over Union points (mIoU) and by 48.3 mIoU in our semi-supervised approach. We demonstrate a similar improvement for the SemanticKITTI to nuScenes domain adaptation by 21.8 mIoU and 51.5 mIoU, respectively. We compare our method with two state of the art approaches for semantic lidar segmentation domain adaptation with a significant improvement for unsupervised and semi-supervised domain adaptation. Furthermore we successfully apply our proposed method to two entirely unlabeled datasets of two state of the art lidar sensors Velodyne Alpha Prime and InnovizTwo, and train well performing semantic segmentation networks for both.

 - **Abstract**
 Accurate and robust extrinsic calibration is necessary for deploying autonomous systems which need multiple sensors for perception. In this paper, we present a robust system for real-time extrinsic calibration of multiple lidars in vehicle base frame without the need for any fiducial markers or features. We base our approach on matching absolute GNSS and estimated lidar poses in real-time. Comparing rotation components allows us to improve the robustness of the solution than traditional least-square approach comparing translation components only. Additionally, instead of comparing all corresponding poses, we select poses comprising maximum mutual information based on our novel observability criteria. This allows us to identify a subset of the poses helpful for real-time calibration. We also provide stopping criteria for ensuring calibration completion. To validate our approach extensive tests were carried out on data collected using Scania test vehicles (7 sequences for a total of ~ 6.5 Km). The results presented in this paper show that our approach is able to accurately determine the extrinsic calibration for various combinations of sensor setups.

 - **Abstract**
 Neural radiance fields (NeRF) have demonstrated the potential of coordinate-based neural representation (neural fields or implicit neural representation) in neural rendering. However, using a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) to represent a 3D scene or object requires enormous computational resources and time. There have been recent studies on how to reduce these computational inefficiencies by using additional data structures, such as grids or trees. Despite the promising performance, the explicit data structure necessitates a substantial amount of memory. In this work, we present a method to reduce the size without compromising the advantages of having additional data structures. In detail, we propose using the wavelet transform on grid-based neural fields. Grid-based neural fields are for fast convergence, and the wavelet transform, whose efficiency has been demonstrated in high-performance standard codecs, is to improve the parameter efficiency of grids. Furthermore, in order to achieve a higher sparsity of grid coefficients while maintaining reconstruction quality, we present a novel trainable masking approach. Experimental results demonstrate that non-spatial grid coefficients, such as wavelet coefficients, are capable of attaining a higher level of sparsity than spatial grid coefficients, resulting in a more compact representation. With our proposed mask and compression pipeline, we achieved state-of-the-art performance within a memory budget of 2 MB. Our code is available at https://github.com/daniel03c1/masked_wavelet_nerf.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent advances in Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) treat the problem of novel view synthesis as Sparse Radiance Field (SRF) optimization using sparse voxels for efficient and fast rendering (plenoxels,InstantNGP). In order to leverage machine learning and adoption of SRFs as a 3D representation, we present SPARF, a large-scale ShapeNet-based synthetic dataset for novel view synthesis consisting of $\sim$ 17 million images rendered from nearly 40,000 shapes at high resolution (400 X 400 pixels). The dataset is orders of magnitude larger than existing synthetic datasets for novel view synthesis and includes more than one million 3D-optimized radiance fields with multiple voxel resolutions. Furthermore, we propose a novel pipeline (SuRFNet) that learns to generate sparse voxel radiance fields from only few views. This is done by using the densely collected SPARF dataset and 3D sparse convolutions. SuRFNet employs partial SRFs from few/one images and a specialized SRF loss to learn to generate high-quality sparse voxel radiance fields that can be rendered from novel views. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results in the task of unconstrained novel view synthesis based on few views on ShapeNet as compared to recent baselines. The SPARF dataset will be made public with the code and models on the project website https://abdullahamdi.com/sparf/ .

 - **Abstract**
 Stylized view generation of scenes captured casually using a camera has received much attention recently. The geometry and appearance of the scene are typically captured as neural point sets or neural radiance fields in the previous work. An image stylization method is used to stylize the captured appearance by training its network jointly or iteratively with the structure capture network. The state-of-the-art SNeRF method trains the NeRF and stylization network in an alternating manner. These methods have high training time and require joint optimization. In this work, we present StyleTRF, a compact, quick-to-optimize strategy for stylized view generation using TensoRF. The appearance part is fine-tuned using sparse stylized priors of a few views rendered using the TensoRF representation for a few iterations. Our method thus effectively decouples style-adaption from view capture and is much faster than the previous methods. We show state-of-the-art results on several scenes used for this purpose.
### Correspondence Distillation from NeRF-based GAN

 - **Abstract**
 The neural radiance field (NeRF) has shown promising results in preserving the fine details of objects and scenes. However, unlike mesh-based representations, it remains an open problem to build dense correspondences across different NeRFs of the same category, which is essential in many downstream tasks. The main difficulties of this problem lie in the implicit nature of NeRF and the lack of ground-truth correspondence annotations. In this paper, we show it is possible to bypass these challenges by leveraging the rich semantics and structural priors encapsulated in a pre-trained NeRF-based GAN. Specifically, we exploit such priors from three aspects, namely 1) a dual deformation field that takes latent codes as global structural indicators, 2) a learning objective that regards generator features as geometric-aware local descriptors, and 3) a source of infinite object-specific NeRF samples. Our experiments demonstrate that such priors lead to 3D dense correspondence that is accurate, smooth, and robust. We also show that established dense correspondence across NeRFs can effectively enable many NeRF-based downstream applications such as texture transfer.

### Attentiveness Map Estimation for Haptic Teleoperation of Mobile Robot  Obstacle Avoidance and Approach
 - **Authors:** Ninghan Zhong, Kris Hauser
 - **Subjects:** Robotics (cs.RO)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08742
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.08742
 - **Abstract**
 Haptic feedback can improve safety of teleoperated robots when situational awareness is limited or operators are inattentive. Standard potential field approaches increase haptic resistance as an obstacle is approached, which is desirable when the operator is unaware of the obstacle but undesirable when the movement is intentional, such as when the operator wishes to inspect or manipulate an object. This paper presents a novel haptic teleoperation framework that estimates the operator's attentiveness to dampen haptic feedback for intentional movement. A biologically-inspired attention model is developed based on computational working memory theories to integrate visual saliency estimation with spatial mapping. This model generates an attentiveness map in real-time, and the haptic rendering system generates lower haptic forces for obstacles that the operator is estimated to be aware of. Experimental results in simulation show that the proposed framework outperforms haptic teleoperation without attentiveness estimation in terms of task performance, robot safety, and user experience.

 - **Abstract**
 Achieving artificially intelligent-native wireless networks is necessary for the operation of future 6G applications such as the metaverse. Nonetheless, current communication schemes are, at heart, a mere reconstruction process that lacks reasoning. One key solution that enables evolving wireless communication to a human-like conversation is semantic communications. In this paper, a novel machine reasoning framework is proposed to pre-process and disentangle source data so as to make it semantic-ready. In particular, a novel contrastive learning framework is proposed, whereby instance and cluster discrimination are performed on the data. These two tasks enable increasing the cohesiveness between data points mapping to semantically similar content elements and disentangling data points of semantically different content elements. Subsequently, the semantic deep clusters formed are ranked according to their level of confidence. Deep semantic clusters of highest confidence are considered learnable, semantic-rich data, i.e., data that can be used to build a language in a semantic communications system. The least confident ones are considered, random, semantic-poor, and memorizable data that must be transmitted classically. Our simulation results showcase the superiority of our contrastive learning approach in terms of semantic impact and minimalism. In fact, the length of the semantic representation achieved is minimized by 57.22% compared to vanilla semantic communication systems, thus achieving minimalist semantic representations.

 - **Abstract**
 Deep unfolding networks (DUNs) have proven to be a viable approach to compressive sensing (CS). In this work, we propose a DUN called low-rank CS network (LR-CSNet) for natural image CS. Real-world image patches are often well-represented by low-rank approximations. LR-CSNet exploits this property by adding a low-rank prior to the CS optimization task. We derive a corresponding iterative optimization procedure using variable splitting, which is then translated to a new DUN architecture. The architecture uses low-rank generation modules (LRGMs), which learn low-rank matrix factorizations, as well as gradient descent and proximal mappings (GDPMs), which are proposed to extract high-frequency features to refine image details. In addition, the deep features generated at each reconstruction stage in the DUN are transferred between stages to boost the performance. Our extensive experiments on three widely considered datasets demonstrate the promising performance of LR-CSNet compared to state-of-the-art methods in natural image CS.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.09239
 - **Abstract**
 The non-interactive source simulation (NISS) scenario is considered. In this scenario, a pair of distributed agents, Alice and Bob, observe a distributed binary memoryless source $(X^d,Y^d)$ generated based on joint distribution $P_{X,Y}$. The agents wish to produce a pair of discrete random variables $(U_d,V_d)$ with joint distribution $P_{U_d,V_d}$, such that $P_{U_d,V_d}$ converges in total variation distance to a target distribution $Q_{U,V}$ as the input blocklength $d$ is taken to be asymptotically large. Inner and outer bounds are obtained on the set of distributions $Q_{U,V}$ which can be produced given an input distribution $P_{X,Y}$. To this end, a bijective mapping from the set of distributions $Q_{U,V}$ to a union of star-convex sets is provided. By leveraging proof techniques from discrete Fourier analysis along with a novel randomized rounding technique, inner and outer bounds are derived for each of these star-convex sets, and by inverting the aforementioned bijective mapping, necessary and sufficient conditions on $Q_{U,V}$ and $P_{X,Y}$ are provided under which $Q_{U,V}$ can be produced from $P_{X,Y}$. The bounds are applicable in NISS scenarios where the output alphabets $\mathcal{U}$ and $\mathcal{V}$ have arbitrary finite size. In case of binary output alphabets, the outer-bound recovers the previously best-known outer-bound.

 - **Abstract**
 Robustness evaluation against adversarial examples has become increasingly important to unveil the trustworthiness of the prevailing deep models in natural language processing (NLP). However, in contrast to the computer vision domain where the first-order projected gradient descent (PGD) is used as the benchmark approach to generate adversarial examples for robustness evaluation, there lacks a principled first-order gradient-based robustness evaluation framework in NLP. The emerging optimization challenges lie in 1) the discrete nature of textual inputs together with the strong coupling between the perturbation location and the actual content, and 2) the additional constraint that the perturbed text should be fluent and achieve a low perplexity under a language model. These challenges make the development of PGD-like NLP attacks difficult. To bridge the gap, we propose TextGrad, a new attack generator using gradient-driven optimization, supporting high-accuracy and high-quality assessment of adversarial robustness in NLP. Specifically, we address the aforementioned challenges in a unified optimization framework. And we develop an effective convex relaxation method to co-optimize the continuously-relaxed site selection and perturbation variables and leverage an effective sampling method to establish an accurate mapping from the continuous optimization variables to the discrete textual perturbations. Moreover, as a first-order attack generation method, TextGrad can be baked into adversarial training to further improve the robustness of NLP models. Extensive experiments are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of TextGrad not only in attack generation for robustness evaluation but also in adversarial defense.
### Real-Time Rendering of Arbitrary Surface Geometries using Learnt  Transfer

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.09315
 - **Abstract**
 Precomputed Radiance Transfer (PRT) is widely used for real-time photorealistic effects. PRT disentangles the rendering equation into transfer and lighting, enabling their precomputation. Transfer accounts for the cosine-weighted visibility of points in the scene while lighting for emitted radiance from the environment. Prior art stored precomputed transfer in a tabulated manner, either in vertex or texture space. These values are fetched with interpolation at each point for shading. Vertex space methods require densely tessellated mesh vertices for high quality images. Texture space methods require non-overlapping and area-preserving UV mapping to be available. They also require a high-resolution texture to avoid rendering artifacts. In this paper, we propose a compact transfer representation that is learnt directly on scene geometry points. Specifically, we train a small multi-layer perceptron (MLP) to predict the transfer at sampled surface points. Our approach is most beneficial where inherent mesh storage structure and natural UV mapping are not available, such as Implicit Surfaces as it learns the transfer values directly on the surface. We demonstrate real-time, photorealistic renderings of diffuse and glossy materials on SDF geometries with PRT using our approach.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.09692
 - **Abstract**
 Pixel art is a popular artistic style adopted in the gaming industry, and nowadays, it is often accompanied by modern rendering techniques. One example is dynamic lighting for the game sprites, for which normal mapping defines how the light interacts with the material represented by each pixel. Although there are different methods to generate normal maps for 3D games, applying them for pixel art may not yield correct results due to the style specificities. Therefore, this work compiles different normal map generation methods and study their applicability for pixel art, reducing the scarcity of existing material on the techniques and contributing to a qualitative analysis of the behavior of these methods in different case studies.

 - **Abstract**
 Localizing targets outside the anchors' convex hull is an understudied but prevalent scenario in vehicle-centric, UAV-based, and self-localization applications. Considering such scenarios, this paper studies the optimal anchor placement problem for Time-of-Arrival (ToA)-based localization schemes such that the worst-case Dilution of Precision (DOP) is minimized. Building on prior results on DOP scaling laws for beyond convex hull ToA-based localization, we propose a novel metric termed the Range-Normalized DOP (RNDOP). We show that the worst-case DOP-optimal anchor placement problem simplifies to a min-max RNDOP-optimal anchor placement problem. Unfortunately, this formulation results in a non-convex and intractable problem under realistic constraints. To overcome this, we propose iterative anchor addition schemes, which result in a tractable albeit non-convex problem. By exploiting the structure arising from the resultant rank-1 update, we devise three heuristic schemes with varying performance-complexity tradeoffs. In addition, we also derive the upper and lower bounds for scenarios where we are placing anchors to optimize the worst-case (a) 3D positioning error and (b) 2D positioning error. We build on these results to design a cohesive iterative algorithmic framework for robust anchor placement and then discuss the computational complexity of the proposed schemes. Using numerical results, we validate the accuracy of our theoretical results. We also present comprehensive Monte-Carlo simulation results to compare the positioning error and execution time performance of each iterative scheme, discuss the tradeoffs, and provide valuable system design insights for beyond convex hull localization scenarios.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.08902
 - **Abstract**
 The task of text-to-SQL is to convert a natural language question to its corresponding SQL query in the context of relational tables. Existing text-to-SQL parsers generate a "plausible" SQL query for an arbitrary user question, thereby failing to correctly handle problematic user questions. To formalize this problem, we conduct a preliminary study on the observed ambiguous and unanswerable cases in text-to-SQL and summarize them into 6 feature categories. Correspondingly, we identify the causes behind each category and propose requirements for handling ambiguous and unanswerable questions. Following this study, we propose a simple yet effective counterfactual example generation approach for the automatic generation of ambiguous and unanswerable text-to-SQL examples. Furthermore, we propose a weakly supervised model DTE (Detecting-Then-Explaining) for error detection, localization, and explanation. Experimental results show that our model achieves the best result on both real-world examples and generated examples compared with various baselines. We will release data and code for future research.

 - **Abstract**
 We propose a decentralized control algorithm for a minimalistic robotic swarm with limited capabilities such that the desired global behavior emerges. We consider the problem of searching for and encapsulating various targets present in the environment while avoiding collisions with both static and dynamic obstacles. The novelty of this work is the guaranteed generation of desired complex swarm behavior with constrained individual robots which have no memory, no localization, and no knowledge of the exact relative locations of their neighbors. Moreover, we analyze how the emergent behavior changes with different parameters of the task, noise in the sensor reading, and asynchronous execution.

 - **Abstract**
 Using historical data to predict future events has many applications in the real world, such as stock price prediction; the robot localization. In the past decades, the Convolutional long short-term memory (LSTM) networks have achieved extraordinary success with sequential data in the related field. However, traditional recurrent neural networks (RNNs) keep the hidden states in a deterministic way. In this paper, we use the particles to approximate the distribution of the latent state and show how it can extend into a more complex form, i.e., the Encoder-Decoder mechanism. With the proposed continuous differentiable scheme, our model is capable of adaptively extracting valuable information and updating the latent state according to the Bayes rule. Our empirical studies demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in the prediction tasks.

 - **Abstract**
 With the steady emergence of community question answering (CQA) platforms like Quora, StackExchange, and WikiHow, users now have an unprecedented access to information on various kind of queries and tasks. Moreover, the rapid proliferation and localization of these platforms spanning geographic and linguistic boundaries offer a unique opportunity to study the task requirements and preferences of users in different socio-linguistic groups. In this study, we implement an entity-embedding model trained on a large longitudinal dataset of multi-lingual and task-oriented question-answer pairs to uncover and quantify the (i) prevalence and distribution of various online tasks across linguistic communities, and (ii) emerging and receding trends in task popularity over time in these communities. Our results show that there exists substantial variance in task preference as well as popularity trends across linguistic communities on the platform. Findings from this study will help Q&A platforms better curate and personalize content for non-English users, while also offering valuable insights to businesses looking to target non-English speaking communities online.

 - **Abstract**
 Fine-grained semantic segmentation of a person's face and head, including facial parts and head components, has progressed a great deal in recent years. However, it remains a challenging task, whereby considering ambiguous occlusions and large pose variations are particularly difficult. To overcome these difficulties, we propose a novel framework termed Mask-FPAN. It uses a de-occlusion module that learns to parse occluded faces in a semi-supervised way. In particular, face landmark localization, face occlusionstimations, and detected head poses are taken into account. A 3D morphable face model combined with the UV GAN improves the robustness of 2D face parsing. In addition, we introduce two new datasets named FaceOccMask-HQ and CelebAMaskOcc-HQ for face paring work. The proposed Mask-FPAN framework addresses the face parsing problem in the wild and shows significant performance improvements with MIOU from 0.7353 to 0.9013 compared to the state-of-the-art on challenging face datasets.

 We tackle a new problem of multi-view camera and subject registration in the bird's eye view (BEV) without pre-given camera calibration. This is a very challenging problem since its only input is several RGB images from different first-person views (FPVs) for a multi-person scene, without the BEV image and the calibration of the FPVs, while the output is a unified plane with the localization and orientation of both the subjects and cameras in a BEV. We propose an end-to-end framework solving this problem, whose main idea can be divided into following parts: i) creating a view-transform subject detection module to transform the FPV to a virtual BEV including localization and orientation of each pedestrian, ii) deriving a geometric transformation based method to estimate camera localization and view direction, i.e., the camera registration in a unified BEV, iii) making use of spatial and appearance information to aggregate the subjects into the unified BEV. We collect a new large-scale synthetic dataset with rich annotations for evaluation. The experimental results show the remarkable effectiveness of our proposed method.

 - **Abstract**
 Weakly-supervised temporal action localization (WTAL) learns to detect and classify action instances with only category labels. Most methods widely adopt the off-the-shelf Classification-Based Pre-training (CBP) to generate video features for action localization. However, the different optimization objectives between classification and localization, make temporally localized results suffer from the serious incomplete issue. To tackle this issue without additional annotations, this paper considers to distill free action knowledge from Vision-Language Pre-training (VLP), since we surprisingly observe that the localization results of vanilla VLP have an over-complete issue, which is just complementary to the CBP results. To fuse such complementarity, we propose a novel distillation-collaboration framework with two branches acting as CBP and VLP respectively. The framework is optimized through a dual-branch alternate training strategy. Specifically, during the B step, we distill the confident background pseudo-labels from the CBP branch; while during the F step, the confident foreground pseudo-labels are distilled from the VLP branch. And as a result, the dual-branch complementarity is effectively fused to promote a strong alliance. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on THUMOS14 and ActivityNet1.2 reveal that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

 - **Abstract**
 In video person re-identification (Re-ID), the network must consistently extract features of the target person from successive frames. Existing methods tend to focus only on how to use temporal information, which often leads to networks being fooled by similar appearances and same backgrounds. In this paper, we propose a Disentanglement and Switching and Aggregation Network (DSANet), which segregates the features representing identity and features based on camera characteristics, and pays more attention to ID information. We also introduce an auxiliary task that utilizes a new pair of features created through switching and aggregation to increase the network's capability for various camera scenarios. Furthermore, we devise a Target Localization Module (TLM) that extracts robust features against a change in the position of the target according to the frame flow and a Frame Weight Generation (FWG) that reflects temporal information in the final representation. Various loss functions for disentanglement learning are designed so that each component of the network can cooperate while satisfactorily performing its own role. Quantitative and qualitative results from extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of DSANet over state-of-the-art methods on three benchmark datasets.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper presents an image-based visual servo control (IBVS) method for a first-person-view (FPV) quadrotor to conduct aggressive aerial tracking. There are three major challenges to maneuvering an underactuated vehicle using IBVS: (i) finding a visual feature representation that is robust to large rotations and is suited to be an optimization variable; (ii) keeping the target visible without sacrificing the robot's agility; and (iii) compensating for the rotational effects in the detected features. We propose a complete design framework to address these problems. First, we employ a rotation on $SO(3)$ to represent a spherical image feature on $S^{2}$ to gain singularity-free and second-order differentiable properties. To ensure target visibility, we formulate the IBVS as a nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) problem with three constraints taken into account: the robot's physical limits, target visibility, and time-to-collision (TTC). Furthermore, we propose a novel attitude-compensation scheme to enable formulating the visibility constraint in the actual image plane instead of a virtual fix-orientation image plane. It guarantees that the visibility constraint is valid under large rotations. Extensive experimental results show that our method can track a fast-moving target stably and aggressively without the aid of a localization system.

 - **Abstract**
 Unsupervised pre-training on millions of digital-born or scanned documents has shown promising advances in visual document understanding~(VDU). While various vision-language pre-training objectives are studied in existing solutions, the document textline, as an intrinsic granularity in VDU, has seldom been explored so far. A document textline usually contains words that are spatially and semantically correlated, which can be easily obtained from OCR engines. In this paper, we propose Wukong-Reader, trained with new pre-training objectives to leverage the structural knowledge nested in document textlines. We introduce textline-region contrastive learning to achieve fine-grained alignment between the visual regions and texts of document textlines. Furthermore, masked region modeling and textline-grid matching are also designed to enhance the visual and layout representations of textlines. Experiments show that our Wukong-Reader has superior performance on various VDU tasks such as information extraction. The fine-grained alignment over textlines also empowers Wukong-Reader with promising localization ability.

 - **Abstract**
 Vision-Language Pre-Training (VLP) has shown promising capabilities to align image and text pairs, facilitating a broad variety of cross-modal learning tasks. However, we observe that VLP models often lack the visual grounding/localization capability which is critical for many downstream tasks such as visual reasoning. In this work, we propose a novel Position-guided Text Prompt (PTP) paradigm to enhance the visual grounding ability of cross-modal models trained with VLP. Specifically, in the VLP phase, PTP divides the image into $N\times N$ blocks, and identifies the objects in each block through the widely used object detector in VLP. It then reformulates the visual grounding task into a fill-in-the-blank problem given a PTP by encouraging the model to predict the objects in the given blocks or regress the blocks of a given object, e.g. filling `P" or ``O" in aPTP ``The block P has a O". This mechanism improves the visual grounding capability of VLP models and thus helps them better handle various downstream tasks. By introducing PTP into several state-of-the-art VLP frameworks, we observe consistently significant improvements across representative cross-modal learning model architectures and several benchmarks, e.g. zero-shot Flickr30K Retrieval (+4.8 in average recall@1) for ViLT \cite{vilt} baseline, and COCO Captioning (+5.3 in CIDEr) for SOTA BLIP \cite{blip} baseline. Moreover, PTP achieves comparable results with object-detector based methods, and much faster inference speed since PTP discards its object detector for inference while the later cannot. Our code and pre-trained weight will be released at \url{https://github.com/sail-sg/ptp}.

### 'Rarely' a problem? Language models exhibit inverse scaling in their  predictions following 'few'-type quantifiers

 - **Abstract**
 Language Models appear to perform poorly on quantification. We ask how badly. 'Few'-type quantifiers, as in 'few children like vegetables' might pose a particular challenge for Language Models, since the sentence components without the quantifier are likely to co-occur, and because 'few'-type quantifiers are rare. We present 960 sentences stimuli from two human neurolinguistic experiments to 22 autoregressive transformer models of differing sizes. Not only do the models perform poorly on 'few'-type quantifiers, but overall the larger the model, the worse its performance. We interpret this inverse scaling as suggesting that larger models increasingly reflect online rather than offline human processing, and argue that decreasing performance of larger models may challenge uses of Language Models as the basis for Natural Language Systems.

 - **Abstract**
 The outburst of COVID-19 in late 2019 was the start of a health crisis that shook the world and took millions of lives in the ensuing years. Many governments and health officials failed to arrest the rapid circulation of infection in their communities. The long incubation period and the large proportion of asymptomatic cases made COVID-19 particularly elusive to track. However, wastewater monitoring soon became a promising data source in addition to conventional indicators such as confirmed daily cases, hospitalizations, and deaths. Despite the consensus on the effectiveness of wastewater viral load data, there is a lack of methodological approaches that leverage viral load to improve COVID-19 forecasting. This paper proposes using deep learning to automatically discover the relationship between daily confirmed cases and viral load data. We trained one Deep Temporal Convolutional Networks (DeepTCN) and one Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) model to build a global forecasting model. We supplement the daily confirmed cases with viral loads and other socio-economic factors as covariates to the models. Our results suggest that TFT outperforms DeepTCN and learns a better association between viral load and daily cases. We demonstrated that equipping the models with the viral load improves their forecasting performance significantly. Moreover, viral load is shown to be the second most predictive input, following the containment and health index. Our results reveal the feasibility of training a location-agnostic deep-learning model to capture the dynamics of infection diffusion when wastewater viral load data is provided.

 - **Abstract**
 Language models with the Transformers structure have shown great performance in natural language processing. However, there still poses problems when fine-tuning pre-trained language models on downstream tasks, such as over-fitting or representation collapse. In this work, we propose HyPe, a simple yet effective fine-tuning technique to alleviate such problems by perturbing hidden representations of Transformers layers. Unlike previous works that only add noise to inputs or parameters, we argue that the hidden representations of Transformers layers convey more diverse and meaningful language information. Therefore, making the Transformers layers more robust to hidden representation perturbations can further benefit the fine-tuning of PLMs en bloc. We conduct extensive experiments and analyses on GLUE and other natural language inference datasets. Results demonstrate that HyPe outperforms vanilla fine-tuning and enhances generalization of hidden representations from different layers. In addition, HyPe acquires negligible computational overheads, and is better than and compatible with previous state-of-the-art fine-tuning techniques.

 - **Abstract**
 This work introduces the design analysis simulation and a standard MEMS fabrication process for a three dimensional microcoil with a magnetic core and a digital switch configuration using a completely integrated fully MEMS compatible process to achieve a digitally controlled inductance. The proposed design can also be utilized as a micro transformer. The proposed design consists of five identical 3D coils and their corresponding MEMS switches. These coils are digitally controlled to achieve a variable inductor ranging from one fifth of the coil inductance up to five times the coil inductance. A standard five layer Polymumps process is proposed to fabricate the microcoils and the integrated switches. Each micro coil is anchored directly on chip connected to the input signal from one side and the other is connected to the switch. The Ni based magnetic core improves the coil response by confining and guiding the magnetic field in the magnetic device compared to Si core based by more than five times. The presented coil has the number of windings limited by the designed length and the minimum spacing that can be realized by standard optical lithography. The coil diameter is also restricted by the limits defined by optical lithography whereas the maximum height realizable by the Polymumps process limits the height of the magnetic core and accordingly results in lower inductor performance. Based on this technique we present coils ranging from 100 um in length and ten winding up to 1000 um in length and 100 windings. The new monolithically integrated MEMS switches act as selectors to achieve a variable inductance with digital control to allow the selection among n inductance steps where n is the number of coils.

 - **Abstract**
 Chatbots are expected to be knowledgeable across multiple domains, e.g. for daily chit-chat, exchange of information, and grounding in emotional situations. To effectively measure the quality of such conversational agents, a model-based automatic dialogue evaluation metric (ADEM) is expected to perform well across multiple domains. Despite significant progress, an ADEM that works well in one domain does not necessarily generalize to another. This calls for a dedicated network architecture for domain generalization. To tackle the multi-domain dialogue evaluation task, we propose a Panel of Experts (PoE), a multitask network that consists of a shared transformer encoder and a collection of lightweight adapters. The shared encoder captures the general knowledge of dialogues across domains, while each adapter specializes in one specific domain and serves as a domain expert. To validate the idea, we construct a high-quality multi-domain dialogue dataset leveraging data augmentation and pseudo-labeling. The PoE network is comprehensively assessed on 16 dialogue evaluation datasets spanning a wide range of dialogue domains. It achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of mean Spearman correlation over all the evaluation datasets. It exhibits better zero-shot generalization than existing state-of-the-art ADEMs and the ability to easily adapt to new domains with few-shot transfer learning.

 - **Abstract**
 Training of neural networks is a computationally intensive task. The significance of understanding and modeling the training dynamics is growing as increasingly larger networks are being trained. We propose in this work a model based on the correlation of the parameters' dynamics, which dramatically reduces the dimensionality. We refer to our algorithm as \emph{correlation mode decomposition} (CMD). It splits the parameter space into groups of parameters (modes) which behave in a highly correlated manner through the epochs. We achieve a remarkable dimensionality reduction with this approach, where networks like ResNet-18, transformers and GANs, containing millions of parameters, can be modeled well using just a few modes. We observe each typical time profile of a mode is spread throughout the network in all layers. Moreover, our model induces regularization which yields better generalization capacity on the test set. This representation enhances the understanding of the underlying training dynamics and can pave the way for designing better acceleration techniques.

 - **Abstract**
 Domain shift widely exists in the visual world, while modern deep neural networks commonly suffer from severe performance degradation under domain shift due to the poor generalization ability, which limits the real-world applications. The domain shift mainly lies in the limited source environmental variations and the large distribution gap between source and unseen target data. To this end, we propose a unified framework, Style-HAllucinated Dual consistEncy learning (SHADE), to handle such domain shift in various visual tasks. Specifically, SHADE is constructed based on two consistency constraints, Style Consistency (SC) and Retrospection Consistency (RC). SC enriches the source situations and encourages the model to learn consistent representation across style-diversified samples. RC leverages general visual knowledge to prevent the model from overfitting to source data and thus largely keeps the representation consistent between the source and general visual models. Furthermore, we present a novel style hallucination module (SHM) to generate style-diversified samples that are essential to consistency learning. SHM selects basis styles from the source distribution, enabling the model to dynamically generate diverse and realistic samples during training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our versatile SHADE can significantly enhance the generalization in various visual recognition tasks, including image classification, semantic segmentation and object detection, with different models, i.e., ConvNets and Transformer.

 - **Abstract**
 Robots are traditionally bounded by a fixed embodiment during their operational lifetime, which limits their ability to adapt to their surroundings. Co-optimizing control and morphology of a robot, however, is often inefficient due to the complex interplay between the controller and morphology. In this paper, we propose a learning-based control method that can inherently take morphology into consideration such that once the control policy is trained in the simulator, it can be easily deployed to robots with different embodiments in the real world. In particular, we present the Embodiment-aware Transformer (EAT), an architecture that casts this control problem as conditional sequence modeling. EAT outputs the optimal actions by leveraging a causally masked Transformer. By conditioning an autoregressive model on the desired robot embodiment, past states, and actions, our EAT model can generate future actions that best fit the current robot embodiment. Experimental results show that EAT can outperform all other alternatives in embodiment-varying tasks, and succeed in an example of real-world evolution tasks: stepping down a stair through updating the morphology alone. We hope that EAT will inspire a new push toward real-world evolution across many domains, where algorithms like EAT can blaze a trail by bridging the field of evolutionary robotics and big data sequence modeling.
### Estimating the Adversarial Robustness of Attributions in Text with  Transformers

 - **Abstract**
 Explanations are crucial parts of deep neural network (DNN) classifiers. In high stakes applications, faithful and robust explanations are important to understand and gain trust in DNN classifiers. However, recent work has shown that state-of-the-art attribution methods in text classifiers are susceptible to imperceptible adversarial perturbations that alter explanations significantly while maintaining the correct prediction outcome. If undetected, this can critically mislead the users of DNNs. Thus, it is crucial to understand the influence of such adversarial perturbations on the networks' explanations and their perceptibility. In this work, we establish a novel definition of attribution robustness (AR) in text classification, based on Lipschitz continuity. Crucially, it reflects both attribution change induced by adversarial input alterations and perceptibility of such alterations. Moreover, we introduce a wide set of text similarity measures to effectively capture locality between two text samples and imperceptibility of adversarial perturbations in text. We then propose our novel TransformerExplanationAttack (TEA), a strong adversary that provides a tight estimation for attribution robustness in text classification. TEA uses state-of-the-art language models to extract word substitutions that result in fluent, contextual adversarial samples. Finally, with experiments on several text classification architectures, we show that TEA consistently outperforms current state-of-the-art AR estimators, yielding perturbations that alter explanations to a greater extent while being more fluent and less perceptible.

 - **Abstract**
 Objects in a scene are not always related. The execution efficiency of the one-stage scene graph generation approaches are quite high, which infer the effective relation between entity pairs using sparse proposal sets and a few queries. However, they only focus on the relation between subject and object in triplet set subject entity, predicate entity, object entity, ignoring the relation between subject and predicate or predicate and object, and the model lacks self-reasoning ability. In addition, linguistic modality has been neglected in the one-stage method. It is necessary to mine linguistic modality knowledge to improve model reasoning ability. To address the above-mentioned shortcomings, a Self-reasoning Transformer with Visual-linguistic Knowledge (SrTR) is proposed to add flexible self-reasoning ability to the model. An encoder-decoder architecture is adopted in SrTR, and a self-reasoning decoder is developed to complete three inferences of the triplet set, s+o-p, s+p-o and p+o-s. Inspired by the large-scale pre-training image-text foundation models, visual-linguistic prior knowledge is introduced and a visual-linguistic alignment strategy is designed to project visual representations into semantic spaces with prior knowledge to aid relational reasoning. Experiments on the Visual Genome dataset demonstrate the superiority and fast inference ability of the proposed method.

 - **Abstract**
 Diffusion models have achieved state-of-the-art synthesis quality on visual and audio tasks, and recent works adapt them to textual data by diffusing on the embedding space. But the difference between the continuous data space and the embedding space raises challenges to the diffusion model, which have not been carefully explored. In this paper, we conduct systematic studies and analyze the challenges threefold. Firstly, the data distribution is learnable for embeddings, which may lead to the collapse of the loss function. Secondly, as the norm of embedding varies between popular and rare words, adding the same noise scale will lead to sub-optimal results. In addition, we find that noises sampled from a standard Gaussian distribution may distract the diffusion process. To solve the above challenges, we propose Difformer, a denoising diffusion probabilistic model based on Transformer, which consists of three techniques including utilizing an anchor loss function, a layer normalization module for embeddings, and a norm factor to the Gaussian noise. All techniques are complementary to each other and critical to boosting the model performance together. Experiments are conducted on benchmark datasets over two seminal text generation tasks including machine translation and text summarization. The results show that Difformer significantly outperforms the embedding diffusion baselines, while achieving competitive results with strong autoregressive baselines.

 In recent decades, mobile applications (apps) have gained enormous popularity. Smart services for smart cities increasingly gain attention. The main goal of the proposed research is to present a new AI-powered mobile application on Istanbul's traffic congestion forecast by using traffic density data. It addresses the research question by using time series approaches (LSTM, Transformer, and XGBoost) based on past data over the traffic load dataset combined with meteorological conditions. Analysis of simulation results on predicted models will be discussed according to performance indicators such as MAPE, MAE, and RMSE. And then, it was observed that the Transformer model made the most accurate traffic prediction. The developed traffic forecasting prototype is expected to be a starting point on future products for a mobile application suitable for citizens' daily use.

 - **Abstract**
 In recent years, there has been increased interest in building predictive models that harness natural language processing and machine learning techniques to detect emotions from various text sources, including social media posts, micro-blogs or news articles. Yet, deployment of such models in real-world sentiment and emotion applications faces challenges, in particular poor out-of-domain generalizability. This is likely due to domain-specific differences (e.g., topics, communicative goals, and annotation schemes) that make transfer between different models of emotion recognition difficult. In this work we propose approaches for text-based emotion detection that leverage transformer models (BERT and RoBERTa) in combination with Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) networks trained on a comprehensive set of psycholinguistic features. First, we evaluate the performance of our models within-domain on two benchmark datasets: GoEmotion and ISEAR. Second, we conduct transfer learning experiments on six datasets from the Unified Emotion Dataset to evaluate their out-of-domain robustness. We find that the proposed hybrid models improve the ability to generalize to out-of-distribution data compared to a standard transformer-based approach. Moreover, we observe that these models perform competitively on in-domain data.

 - **Abstract**
 To build Video Question Answering (VideoQA) systems capable of assisting humans in daily activities, seeking answers from long-form videos with diverse and complex events is a must. Existing multi-modal VQA models achieve promising performance on images or short video clips, especially with the recent success of large-scale multi-modal pre-training. However, when extending these methods to long-form videos, new challenges arise. On the one hand, using a dense video sampling strategy is computationally prohibitive. On the other hand, methods relying on sparse sampling struggle in scenarios where multi-event and multi-granularity visual reasoning are required. In this work, we introduce a new model named Multi-modal Iterative Spatial-temporal Transformer (MIST) to better adapt pre-trained models for long-form VideoQA. Specifically, MIST decomposes traditional dense spatial-temporal self-attention into cascaded segment and region selection modules that adaptively select frames and image regions that are closely relevant to the question itself. Visual concepts at different granularities are then processed efficiently through an attention module. In addition, MIST iteratively conducts selection and attention over multiple layers to support reasoning over multiple events. The experimental results on four VideoQA datasets, including AGQA, NExT-QA, STAR, and Env-QA, show that MIST achieves state-of-the-art performance and is superior at computation efficiency and interpretability.

 - **Abstract**
 Knowledge graph (KG) link prediction aims to infer new facts based on existing facts in the KG. Recent studies have shown that using the graph neighborhood of a node via graph neural networks (GNNs) provides more useful information compared to just using the query information. Conventional GNNs for KG link prediction follow the standard message-passing paradigm on the entire KG, which leads to over-smoothing of representations and also limits their scalability. On a large scale, it becomes computationally expensive to aggregate useful information from the entire KG for inference. To address the limitations of existing KG link prediction frameworks, we propose a novel retrieve-and-read framework, which first retrieves a relevant subgraph context for the query and then jointly reasons over the context and the query with a high-capacity reader. As part of our exemplar instantiation for the new framework, we propose a novel Transformer-based GNN as the reader, which incorporates graph-based attention structure and cross-attention between query and context for deep fusion. This design enables the model to focus on salient context information relevant to the query. Empirical results on two standard KG link prediction datasets demonstrate the competitive performance of the proposed method.

 - **Abstract**
 Named Entity Recognition (NER) is an important and well-studied task in natural language processing. The classic CoNLL-2003 English dataset, published almost 20 years ago, is commonly used to train and evaluate named entity taggers. The age of this dataset raises the question of how well these models perform when applied to modern data. In this paper, we present CoNLL++, a new annotated test set that mimics the process used to create the original CoNLL-2003 test set as closely as possible, except with data collected from 2020. Using CoNLL++, we evaluate the generalization of 20+ different models to modern data. We observe that different models have very different generalization behavior. F\textsubscript{1} scores of large transformer-based models which are pre-trained on recent data dropped much less than models using static word embeddings, and RoBERTa-based and T5 models achieve comparable F\textsubscript{1} scores on both CoNLL-2003 and CoNLL++. Our experiments show that achieving good generalizability requires a combined effort of developing larger models and continuing pre-training with in-domain and recent data. These results suggest standard evaluation methodology may have under-estimated progress on named entity recognition over the past 20 years; in addition to improving performance on the original CoNLL-2003 dataset, we have also improved the ability of our models to generalize to modern data.

 - **Abstract**
 We explore a new class of diffusion models based on the transformer architecture. We train latent diffusion models of images, replacing the commonly-used U-Net backbone with a transformer that operates on latent patches. We analyze the scalability of our Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) through the lens of forward pass complexity as measured by Gflops. We find that DiTs with higher Gflops -- through increased transformer depth/width or increased number of input tokens -- consistently have lower FID. In addition to possessing good scalability properties, our largest DiT-XL/2 models outperform all prior diffusion models on the class-conditional ImageNet 512x512 and 256x256 benchmarks, achieving a state-of-the-art FID of 2.27 on the latter.

 - **Abstract**
 Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming all fields of knowledge and production. From surgery, autonomous driving, to image and video creation, AI seems to make possible hitherto unimaginable processes of automation and efficient creation. Media and communication are not an exception, and we are currently witnessing the dawn of powerful AI tools capable of creating artistic images from simple keywords, or to capture emotions from facial expression. These examples may be only the beginning of what can be in the future the engines for automatic AI real time creation of media content linked to the emotional and behavioural responses of individuals. Although it may seem we are still far from there, it is already the moment to adapt our theories about media to the hypothetical scenario in which content production can be done without human intervention, and governed by the controlled any reactions of the individual to the exposure to media content. Following that, I propose the definition of the Integrated Model of Artificial Intelligence-Mediated Communication Effects (IMAGINE), and its consequences on the way we understand media evolution (Scolari, 2012) and we think about media effects (Potter, 2010). The conceptual framework proposed is aimed to help scholars theorizing and doing research in a scenario of continuous real-time connection between AI measurement of people's responses to media, and the AI creation of content, with the objective of optimizing and maximizing the processes of influence. Parasocial interaction and real-time beautification are used as examples to model the functioning of the IMAGINE process.

 - **Abstract**
 Making safe and human-like decisions is an essential capability of autonomous driving systems and learning-based behavior planning is a promising pathway toward this objective. Distinguished from existing learning-based methods that directly output decisions, this work introduces a predictive behavior planning framework that learns to predict and evaluate from human driving data. Concretely, a behavior generation module first produces a diverse set of candidate behaviors in the form of trajectory proposals. Then the proposed conditional motion prediction network is employed to forecast other agents' future trajectories conditioned on each trajectory proposal. Given the candidate plans and associated prediction results, we learn a scoring module to evaluate the plans using maximum entropy inverse reinforcement learning (IRL). We conduct comprehensive experiments to validate the proposed framework on a large-scale real-world urban driving dataset. The results reveal that the conditional prediction model is able to forecast multiple possible future trajectories given a candidate behavior and the prediction results are reactive to different plans. Moreover, the IRL-based scoring module can properly evaluate the trajectory proposals and select close-to-human ones. The proposed framework outperforms other baseline methods in terms of similarity to human driving trajectories. Moreover, we find that the conditional prediction model can improve both prediction and planning performance compared to the non-conditional model, and learning the scoring module is critical to correctly evaluating the candidate plans to align with human drivers.
### Are We Ready for Vision-Centric Driving Streaming Perception? The ASAP  Benchmark

 - **Abstract**
 In recent years, vision-centric perception has flourished in various autonomous driving tasks, including 3D detection, semantic map construction, motion forecasting, and depth estimation. Nevertheless, the latency of vision-centric approaches is too high for practical deployment (e.g., most camera-based 3D detectors have a runtime greater than 300ms). To bridge the gap between ideal research and real-world applications, it is necessary to quantify the trade-off between performance and efficiency. Traditionally, autonomous-driving perception benchmarks perform the offline evaluation, neglecting the inference time delay. To mitigate the problem, we propose the Autonomous-driving StreAming Perception (ASAP) benchmark, which is the first benchmark to evaluate the online performance of vision-centric perception in autonomous driving. On the basis of the 2Hz annotated nuScenes dataset, we first propose an annotation-extending pipeline to generate high-frame-rate labels for the 12Hz raw images. Referring to the practical deployment, the Streaming Perception Under constRained-computation (SPUR) evaluation protocol is further constructed, where the 12Hz inputs are utilized for streaming evaluation under the constraints of different computational resources. In the ASAP benchmark, comprehensive experiment results reveal that the model rank alters under different constraints, suggesting that the model latency and computation budget should be considered as design choices to optimize the practical deployment. To facilitate further research, we establish baselines for camera-based streaming 3D detection, which consistently enhance the streaming performance across various hardware.

 - **Abstract**
 Vegetation Indices based on paired images of the visible color spectrum (VIS) and near infrared spectrum (NIR) have been widely used in remote sensing applications. These vegetation indices are extended for their application in autonomous driving in unstructured outdoor environments. In this domain we can combine traditional vegetation indices like the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) pre-trained on available VIS datasets. By laying a focus on learning calibrated CNN outputs, we can provide an approach to fuse known hand-crafted image features with CNN predictions for different domains as well. The method is evaluated on a VIS+NIR dataset of semantically annotated images in unstructured outdoor environments. The dataset is available at mucar3.de/iros2022-ppniv-tas-nir.

 - **Abstract**
 Robustness of different pattern recognition methods is one of the key challenges in autonomous driving, especially when driving in the high variety of road environments and weather conditions, such as gravel roads and snowfall. Although one can collect data from these adverse conditions using cars equipped with sensors, it is quite tedious to annotate the data for training. In this work, we address this limitation and propose a CNN-based method that can leverage the steering wheel angle information to improve the road area semantic segmentation. As the steering wheel angle data can be easily acquired with the associated images, one could improve the accuracy of road area semantic segmentation by collecting data in new road environments without manual data annotation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on two challenging data sets for autonomous driving and show that when the steering task is used in our segmentation model training, it leads to a 0.1-2.9% gain in the road area mIoU (mean Intersection over Union) compared to the corresponding reference transfer learning model.

 - **Abstract**
 A Complete Computer vision system can be divided into two main categories: detection and classification. The Lane detection algorithm is a part of the computer vision detection category and has been applied in autonomous driving and smart vehicle systems. The lane detection system is responsible for lane marking in a complex road environment. At the same time, lane detection plays a crucial role in the warning system for a car when departs the lane. The implemented lane detection algorithm is mainly divided into two steps: edge detection and line detection. In this paper, we will compare the state-of-the-art implementation performance obtained with both FPGA and GPU to evaluate the trade-off for latency, power consumption, and utilization. Our comparison emphasises the advantages and disadvantages of the two systems.
