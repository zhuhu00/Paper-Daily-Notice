 - **Abstract**
 Visual odometry is crucial for many robotic tasks such as autonomous exploration and path planning. Despite many progresses, existing methods are still not robust enough to dynamic illumination environments. In this paper, we present AirVO, an illumination-robust and accurate stereo visual odometry system based on point and line features. To be robust to illumination variation, we introduce the learning-based feature extraction and matching method and design a novel VO pipeline, including feature tracking, triangulation, key-frame selection, and graph optimization etc. We also employ long line features in the environment to improve the accuracy of the system. Different from the traditional line processing pipelines in visual odometry systems, we propose an illumination-robust line tracking method, where point feature tracking and distribution of point and line features are utilized to match lines. In the experiments, the proposed system is extensively evaluated in environments with dynamic illumination and the results show that it achieves superior performance to the state-of-the-art algorithms.

 - **Abstract**
 Aiming at highly accurate object detection for connected and automated vehicles (CAVs), this paper presents a Deep Neural Network based 3D object detection model that leverages a three-stage feature extractor by developing a novel LIDAR-Camera fusion scheme. The proposed feature extractor extracts high-level features from two input sensory modalities and recovers the important features discarded during the convolutional process. The novel fusion scheme effectively fuses features across sensory modalities and convolutional layers to find the best representative global features. The fused features are shared by a two-stage network: the region proposal network (RPN) and the detection head (DH). The RPN generates high-recall proposals, and the DH produces final detection results. The experimental results show the proposed model outperforms more recent research on the KITTI 2D and 3D detection benchmark, particularly for distant and highly occluded instances.

 - **Abstract**
 Autonomous driving is an exciting new industry, posing important research questions. Within the perception module, 3D human pose estimation is an emerging technology, which can enable the autonomous vehicle to perceive and understand the subtle and complex behaviors of pedestrians. While hardware systems and sensors have dramatically improved over the decades -- with cars potentially boasting complex LiDAR and vision systems and with a growing expansion of the available body of dedicated datasets for this newly available information -- not much work has been done to harness these novel signals for the core problem of 3D human pose estimation. Our method, which we coin HUM3DIL (HUMan 3D from Images and LiDAR), efficiently makes use of these complementary signals, in a semi-supervised fashion and outperforms existing methods with a large margin. It is a fast and compact model for onboard deployment. Specifically, we embed LiDAR points into pixel-aligned multi-modal features, which we pass through a sequence of Transformer refinement stages. Quantitative experiments on the Waymo Open Dataset support these claims, where we achieve state-of-the-art results on the task of 3D pose estimation.

 - **Abstract**
 Time-of-flight (ToF) distance measurement devices such as ultrasonics, LiDAR and radar are widely used in autonomous vehicles for environmental perception, navigation and assisted braking control. Despite their relative importance in making safer driving decisions, these devices are vulnerable to multiple attack types including spoofing, triggering and false data injection. When these attacks are successful they can compromise the security of autonomous vehicles leading to severe consequences for the driver, nearby vehicles and pedestrians. To handle these attacks and protect the measurement devices, we propose a spatial-temporal anomaly detection model \textit{STAnDS} which incorporates a residual error spatial detector, with a time-based expected change detection. This approach is evaluated using a simulated quantitative environment and the results show that \textit{STAnDS} is effective at detecting multiple attack types.

 - **Abstract**
 Vehicle trajectory data has received increasing research attention over the past decades. With the technological sensing improvements such as high-resolution video cameras, in-vehicle radars and lidars, abundant individual and contextual traffic data is now available. However, though the data quantity is massive, it is by itself of limited utility for traffic research because of noise and systematic sensing errors, thus necessitates proper processing to ensure data quality. We draw particular attention to extracting high-resolution vehicle trajectory data from video cameras as traffic monitoring cameras are becoming increasingly ubiquitous. We explore methods for automatic trajectory data reconciliation, given "raw" vehicle detection and tracking information from automatic video processing algorithms. We propose a pipeline including a) an online data association algorithm to match fragments that are associated to the same object (vehicle), which is formulated as a min-cost network flow problem of a graph, and b) a trajectory reconciliation method formulated as a quadratic program to enhance raw detection data. The pipeline leverages vehicle dynamics and physical constraints to associate tracked objects when they become fragmented, remove measurement noise on trajectories and impute missing data due to fragmentations. The accuracy is benchmarked on a sample of manually-labeled data, which shows that the reconciled trajectories improve the accuracy on all the tested input data for a wide range of measures. An online version of the reconciliation pipeline is implemented and will be applied in a continuous video processing system running on a camera network covering a 4-mile stretch of Interstate-24 near Nashville, Tennessee.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent efforts in Neural Rendering Fields (NeRF) have shown impressive results on novel view synthesis by utilizing implicit neural representation to represent 3D scenes. Due to the process of volumetric rendering, the inference speed for NeRF is extremely slow, limiting the application scenarios of utilizing NeRF on resource-constrained hardware, such as mobile devices. Many works have been conducted to reduce the latency of running NeRF models. However, most of them still require high-end GPU for acceleration or extra storage memory, which is all unavailable on mobile devices. Another emerging direction utilizes the neural light field (NeLF) for speedup, as only one forward pass is performed on a ray to predict the pixel color. Nevertheless, to reach a similar rendering quality as NeRF, the network in NeLF is designed with intensive computation, which is not mobile-friendly. In this work, we propose an efficient network that runs in real-time on mobile devices for neural rendering. We follow the setting of NeLF to train our network. Unlike existing works, we introduce a novel network architecture that runs efficiently on mobile devices with low latency and small size, i.e., saving $15\times \sim 24\times$ storage compared with MobileNeRF. Our model achieves high-resolution generation while maintaining real-time inference for both synthetic and real-world scenes on mobile devices, e.g., $18.04$ms (iPhone 13) for rendering one $1008\times756$ image of real 3D scenes. Additionally, we achieve similar image quality as NeRF and better quality than MobileNeRF (PSNR $26.15$ vs. $25.91$ on the real-world forward-facing dataset).

 - **Abstract**
 As a powerful representation of 3D scenes, the neural radiance field (NeRF) enables high-quality novel view synthesis from multi-view images. Stylizing NeRF, however, remains challenging, especially on simulating a text-guided style with both the appearance and the geometry altered simultaneously. In this paper, we present NeRF-Art, a text-guided NeRF stylization approach that manipulates the style of a pre-trained NeRF model with a simple text prompt. Unlike previous approaches that either lack sufficient geometry deformations and texture details or require meshes to guide the stylization, our method can shift a 3D scene to the target style characterized by desired geometry and appearance variations without any mesh guidance. This is achieved by introducing a novel global-local contrastive learning strategy, combined with the directional constraint to simultaneously control both the trajectory and the strength of the target style. Moreover, we adopt a weight regularization method to effectively suppress cloudy artifacts and geometry noises which arise easily when the density field is transformed during geometry stylization. Through extensive experiments on various styles, we demonstrate that our method is effective and robust regarding both single-view stylization quality and cross-view consistency.

### Structurally aware 3D gas distribution mapping using belief propagation:  a real-time algorithm for robotic deployment
 - **Authors:** Callum Rhodes, Cunjia Liu, Wen-Hua Chen
 - **Subjects:** Robotics (cs.RO)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.07552
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.07552
 - **Abstract**
 This paper proposes a new 3D gas distribution mapping technique based on the local message passing of Gaussian belief propagation that is capable of resolving in real time, concentration estimates in 3D space whilst accounting for the obstacle information within the scenario, the first of its kind in the literature. The gas mapping problem is formulated as a 3D factor graph of Gaussian potentials, the connections of which are conditioned on local occupancy values. The Gaussian belief propagation framework is introduced as the solver and a new hybrid message scheduler is introduced to increase the rate of convergence. The factor graph problem is then redesigned as a dynamically expanding inference task, coupling the information of consecutive gas measurements with local spatial structure obtained by the robot. The proposed algorithm is compared to the state of the art methods in 2D and 3D simulations and is found to resolve distribution maps orders of magnitude quicker than typical direct solvers. The proposed framework is then deployed for the first time onboard a ground robot in a 3D mapping and exploration task. The system is shown to be able to resolve multiple sensor inputs and output high resolution 3D gas distribution maps in a GPS denied cluttered scenario in real time. This online inference of complicated plume structures provides a new layer of contextual information over its 2D counterparts and enables autonomous systems to take advantage of real time estimates to inform potential next best sampling locations.
### Generative structured normalizing flow Gaussian processes applied to  spectroscopic data

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.07554
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.07554
 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we propose a novel generative model for mapping inputs to structured, high-dimensional outputs using structured conditional normalizing flows and Gaussian process regression. The model is motivated by the need to characterize uncertainty in the input/output relationship when making inferences on new data. In particular, in the physical sciences, limited training data may not adequately characterize future observed data; it is critical that models adequately indicate uncertainty, particularly when they may be asked to extrapolate. In our proposed model, structured conditional normalizing flows provide parsimonious latent representations that relate to the inputs through a Gaussian process, providing exact likelihood calculations and uncertainty that naturally increases away from the training data inputs. We demonstrate the methodology on laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy data from the ChemCam instrument onboard the Mars rover Curiosity. ChemCam was designed to recover the chemical composition of rock and soil samples by measuring the spectral properties of plasma atomic emissions induced by a laser pulse. We show that our model can generate realistic spectra conditional on a given chemical composition and that we can use the model to perform uncertainty quantification of chemical compositions for new observed spectra. Based on our results, we anticipate that our proposed modeling approach may be useful in other scientific domains with high-dimensional, complex structure where it is important to quantify predictive uncertainty.
### Interpretable ML for Imbalanced Data

 - **Abstract**
 Deep learning models are being increasingly applied to imbalanced data in high stakes fields such as medicine, autonomous driving, and intelligence analysis. Imbalanced data compounds the black-box nature of deep networks because the relationships between classes may be highly skewed and unclear. This can reduce trust by model users and hamper the progress of developers of imbalanced learning algorithms. Existing methods that investigate imbalanced data complexity are geared toward binary classification, shallow learning models and low dimensional data. In addition, current eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques mainly focus on converting opaque deep learning models into simpler models (e.g., decision trees) or mapping predictions for specific instances to inputs, instead of examining global data properties and complexities. Therefore, there is a need for a framework that is tailored to modern deep networks, that incorporates large, high dimensional, multi-class datasets, and uncovers data complexities commonly found in imbalanced data (e.g., class overlap, sub-concepts, and outlier instances). We propose a set of techniques that can be used by both deep learning model users to identify, visualize and understand class prototypes, sub-concepts and outlier instances; and by imbalanced learning algorithm developers to detect features and class exemplars that are key to model performance. Our framework also identifies instances that reside on the border of class decision boundaries, which can carry highly discriminative information. Unlike many existing XAI techniques which map model decisions to gray-scale pixel locations, we use saliency through back-propagation to identify and aggregate image color bands across entire classes. Our framework is publicly available at \url{https://github.com/dd1github/XAI_for_Imbalanced_Learning}
### Online Heatmap Generation with Both High and Low Weights
 - **Authors:** Yan Y. Liu, Melissa Allen-Dumas
 - **Subjects:** Graphics (cs.GR)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.07820
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.07820
 - **Abstract**
 Heatmap is a common geovisualization method that interpolates and visualizes a set of point observations on a map surface. Most of online web mapping libraries implement a one-pass heatmap algorithm using HTML5 canvas or WebGL for efficient heatmap generation. However, such implementation applies additive operations that accumulate the rendering of point weights on the map surface grid, making it inappropriate for visualizations that require the highlighting of both low and high weights. We introduce \textit{hilomap}, an online heatmap algorithm that highlights surface areas where points with both low and high trends are located. An HTML5 Canvas-based reference implementation on OpenLayers is presented and evaluated.

 - **Abstract**
 Historic dress artifacts are a valuable source for human studies. In particular, they can provide important insights into the social aspects of their corresponding era. These insights are commonly drawn from garment pictures as well as the accompanying descriptions and are usually stored in a standardized and controlled vocabulary that accurately describes garments and costume items, called the Costume Core Vocabulary. Building an accurate Costume Core from garment descriptions can be challenging because the historic garment items are often donated, and the accompanying descriptions can be based on untrained individuals and use a language common to the period of the items. In this paper, we present an approach to use Natural Language Processing (NLP) to map the free-form text descriptions of the historic items to that of the controlled vocabulary provided by the Costume Core. Despite the limited dataset, we were able to train an NLP model based on the Universal Sentence Encoder to perform this mapping with more than 90% test accuracy for a subset of the Costume Core vocabulary. We describe our methodology, design choices, and development of our approach, and show the feasibility of predicting the Costume Core for unseen descriptions. With more garment descriptions still being curated to be used for training, we expect to have higher accuracy for better generalizability.

 - **Abstract**
 Dependency hell is a well-known pain point in the development of large software projects and machine learning (ML) code bases are not immune from it. In fact, ML applications suffer from an additional form, namely, "data source dependency hell". This term refers to the central role played by data and its unique quirks that often lead to unexpected failures of ML models which cannot be explained by code changes. In this paper, we present an automated dependency mapping framework that allows MLOps engineers to monitor the whole dependency map of their models in a fast paced engineering environment and thus mitigate ahead of time the consequences of any data source changes (e.g., re-train model, ignore data, set default data etc.). Our system is based on a unified and generic approach, employing techniques from static analysis, from which data sources can be identified reliably for any type of dependency on a wide range of source languages and artefacts. The dependency mapping framework is exposed as a REST web API where the only input is the path to the Git repository hosting the code base. Currently used by MLOps engineers at Microsoft, we expect such dependency map APIs to be adopted more widely by MLOps engineers in the future.
### Learning Cooperative Beamforming with Edge-Update Empowered Graph Neural  Networks

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.08020
 - **Abstract**
 Cooperative beamforming design has been recognized as an effective approach in modern wireless networks to meet the dramatically increasing demand of various wireless data traffics. It is formulated as an optimization problem in conventional approaches and solved iteratively in an instance-by-instance manner. Recently, learning-based methods have emerged with real-time implementation by approximating the mapping function from the problem instances to the corresponding solutions. Among various neural network architectures, graph neural networks (GNNs) can effectively utilize the graph topology in wireless networks to achieve better generalization ability on unseen problem sizes. However, the current GNNs are only equipped with the node-update mechanism, which restricts it from modeling more complicated problems such as the cooperative beamforming design, where the beamformers are on the graph edges of wireless networks. To fill this gap, we propose an edge-graph-neural-network (Edge-GNN) by incorporating an edge-update mechanism into the GNN, which learns the cooperative beamforming on the graph edges. Simulation results show that the proposed Edge-GNN achieves higher sum rate with much shorter computation time than state-of-the-art approaches, and generalizes well to different numbers of base stations and user equipments.

### Proposal Distribution Calibration for Few-Shot Object Detection
 - **Authors:** Bohao Li, Chang Liu, Mengnan Shi, Xiaozhong Chen, Xiangyang Ji, Qixiang Ye
 - **Subjects:** Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.07618
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.07618
 - **Abstract**
 Adapting object detectors learned with sufficient supervision to novel classes under low data regimes is charming yet challenging. In few-shot object detection (FSOD), the two-step training paradigm is widely adopted to mitigate the severe sample imbalance, i.e., holistic pre-training on base classes, then partial fine-tuning in a balanced setting with all classes. Since unlabeled instances are suppressed as backgrounds in the base training phase, the learned RPN is prone to produce biased proposals for novel instances, resulting in dramatic performance degradation. Unfortunately, the extreme data scarcity aggravates the proposal distribution bias, hindering the RoI head from evolving toward novel classes. In this paper, we introduce a simple yet effective proposal distribution calibration (PDC) approach to neatly enhance the localization and classification abilities of the RoI head by recycling its localization ability endowed in base training and enriching high-quality positive samples for semantic fine-tuning. Specifically, we sample proposals based on the base proposal statistics to calibrate the distribution bias and impose additional localization and classification losses upon the sampled proposals for fast expanding the base detector to novel classes. Experiments on the commonly used Pascal VOC and MS COCO datasets with explicit state-of-the-art performances justify the efficacy of our PDC for FSOD. Code is available at github.com/Bohao-Lee/PDC.

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.07773
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.07773
 - **Abstract**
 Runtime monitoring provides a more realistic and applicable alternative to verification in the setting of real neural networks used in industry. It is particularly useful for detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs, for which the network was not trained and can yield erroneous results. We extend a runtime-monitoring approach previously proposed for classification networks to perception systems capable of identification and localization of multiple objects. Furthermore, we analyze its adequacy experimentally on different kinds of OOD settings, documenting the overall efficacy of our approach.
### QueryPose: Sparse Multi-Person Pose Regression via Spatial-Aware  Part-Level Query

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.07855
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.07855
 - **Abstract**
 We propose a sparse end-to-end multi-person pose regression framework, termed QueryPose, which can directly predict multi-person keypoint sequences from the input image. The existing end-to-end methods rely on dense representations to preserve the spatial detail and structure for precise keypoint localization. However, the dense paradigm introduces complex and redundant post-processes during inference. In our framework, each human instance is encoded by several learnable spatial-aware part-level queries associated with an instance-level query. First, we propose the Spatial Part Embedding Generation Module (SPEGM) that considers the local spatial attention mechanism to generate several spatial-sensitive part embeddings, which contain spatial details and structural information for enhancing the part-level queries. Second, we introduce the Selective Iteration Module (SIM) to adaptively update the sparse part-level queries via the generated spatial-sensitive part embeddings stage-by-stage. Based on the two proposed modules, the part-level queries are able to fully encode the spatial details and structural information for precise keypoint regression. With the bipartite matching, QueryPose avoids the hand-designed post-processes and surpasses the existing dense end-to-end methods with 73.6 AP on MS COCO mini-val set and 72.7 AP on CrowdPose test set. Code is available at https://github.com/buptxyb666/QueryPose.
### EVAL: Explainable Video Anomaly Localization

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.07900
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.07900
 - **Abstract**
 We develop a novel framework for single-scene video anomaly localization that allows for human-understandable reasons for the decisions the system makes. We first learn general representations of objects and their motions (using deep networks) and then use these representations to build a high-level, location-dependent model of any particular scene. This model can be used to detect anomalies in new videos of the same scene. Importantly, our approach is explainable - our high-level appearance and motion features can provide human-understandable reasons for why any part of a video is classified as normal or anomalous. We conduct experiments on standard video anomaly detection datasets (Street Scene, CUHK Avenue, ShanghaiTech and UCSD Ped1, Ped2) and show significant improvements over the previous state-of-the-art.

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.07428
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.07428
 - **Abstract**
 We introduce a linguistically enhanced combination of pre-training methods for transformers. The pre-training objectives include POS-tagging, synset prediction based on semantic knowledge graphs, and parent prediction based on dependency parse trees. Our approach achieves competitive results on the Natural Language Inference task, compared to the state of the art. Specifically for smaller models, the method results in a significant performance boost, emphasizing the fact that intelligent pre-training can make up for fewer parameters and help building more efficient models. Combining POS-tagging and synset prediction yields the overall best results.

 - **Abstract**
 The promise of Mobile Health (mHealth) is the ability to use wearable sensors to monitor participant physiology at high frequencies during daily life to enable temporally-precise health interventions. However, a major challenge is frequent missing data. Despite a rich imputation literature, existing techniques are ineffective for the pulsative signals which comprise many mHealth applications, and a lack of available datasets has stymied progress. We address this gap with PulseImpute, the first large-scale pulsative signal imputation challenge which includes realistic mHealth missingness models, an extensive set of baselines, and clinically-relevant downstream tasks. Our baseline models include a novel transformer-based architecture designed to exploit the structure of pulsative signals. We hope that PulseImpute will enable the ML community to tackle this significant and challenging task.
### Causes and Cures for Interference in Multilingual Translation

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.07530
 - **Abstract**
 Multilingual machine translation models can benefit from synergy between different language pairs, but also suffer from interference. While there is a growing number of sophisticated methods that aim to eliminate interference, our understanding of interference as a phenomenon is still limited. This work identifies the main factors that contribute to interference in multilingual machine translation. Through systematic experimentation, we find that interference (or synergy) are primarily determined by model size, data size, and the proportion of each language pair within the total dataset. We observe that substantial interference occurs mainly when the model is very small with respect to the available training data, and that using standard transformer configurations with less than one billion parameters largely alleviates interference and promotes synergy. Moreover, we show that tuning the sampling temperature to control the proportion of each language pair in the data is key to balancing the amount of interference between low and high resource language pairs effectively, and can lead to superior performance overall.

 - **Abstract**
 As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes a prominent part of modern life, AI literacy is becoming important for all citizens, not just those in technology careers. Previous research in AI education materials has largely focused on the introduction of terminology as well as AI use cases and ethics, but few allow students to learn by creating their own machine learning models. Therefore, there is a need for enriching AI educational tools with more adaptable and flexible platforms for interested educators with any level of technical experience to utilize within their teaching material. As such, we propose the development of an open-source tool (Build-a-Bot) for students and teachers to not only create their own transformer-based chatbots based on their own course material, but also learn the fundamentals of AI through the model creation process. The primary concern of this paper is the creation of an interface for students to learn the principles of artificial intelligence by using a natural language pipeline to train a customized model to answer questions based on their own school curriculums. The model uses contexts given by their instructor, such as chapters of a textbook, to answer questions and is deployed on an interactive chatbot/voice agent. The pipeline teaches students data collection, data augmentation, intent recognition, and question answering by having them work through each of these processes while creating their AI agent, diverging from previous chatbot work where students and teachers use the bots as black-boxes with no abilities for customization or the bots lack AI capabilities, with the majority of dialogue scripts being rule-based. In addition, our tool is designed to make each step of this pipeline intuitive for students at a middle-school level. Further work primarily lies in providing our tool to schools and seeking student and teacher evaluations.

 - **Abstract**
 Pre-trained language models achieve superior performance, but they are computationally expensive due to their large size. Techniques such as pruning and knowledge distillation (KD) have been developed to reduce their size and latency. In most structural pruning methods, the pruning units, such as attention heads and feed-forward hidden dimensions, only span a small model structure space and limit the structures that the pruning algorithm can explore. In this work, we propose Gradient-based Intra-attention pruning (GRAIN), which inspects fine intra-attention structures, and allows different heads to have different sizes. Intra-attention pruning greatly expands the searching space of model structures and yields highly heterogeneous structures. We further propose structure regularization to encourage generating more regular structures, which achieves higher speedups than heterogeneous ones. We also integrate KD into the pruning process with a gradient separation strategy to reduce the interference of KD with the pruning process. GRAIN is evaluated on a variety of tasks. Results show that it notably outperforms other methods at the same or similar model size. Even under extreme compression where only $3\%$ weights in transformers remain, the pruned model is still competitive.

 - **Abstract**
 Transformers have become the state-of-the-art neural network architecture across numerous domains of machine learning. This is partly due to their celebrated ability to transfer and to learn in-context based on few examples. Nevertheless, the mechanisms by which Transformers become in-context learners are not well understood and remain mostly an intuition. Here, we argue that training Transformers on auto-regressive tasks can be closely related to well-known gradient-based meta-learning formulations. We start by providing a simple weight construction that shows the equivalence of data transformations induced by 1) a single linear self-attention layer and by 2) gradient-descent (GD) on a regression loss. Motivated by that construction, we show empirically that when training self-attention-only Transformers on simple regression tasks either the models learned by GD and Transformers show great similarity or, remarkably, the weights found by optimization match the construction. Thus we show how trained Transformers implement gradient descent in their forward pass. This allows us, at least in the domain of regression problems, to mechanistically understand the inner workings of optimized Transformers that learn in-context. Furthermore, we identify how Transformers surpass plain gradient descent by an iterative curvature correction and learn linear models on deep data representations to solve non-linear regression tasks. Finally, we discuss intriguing parallels to a mechanism identified to be crucial for in-context learning termed induction-head (Olsson et al., 2022) and show how it could be understood as a specific case of in-context learning by gradient descent learning within Transformers.

 - **Abstract**
 Autonomous driving is an exciting new industry, posing important research questions. Within the perception module, 3D human pose estimation is an emerging technology, which can enable the autonomous vehicle to perceive and understand the subtle and complex behaviors of pedestrians. While hardware systems and sensors have dramatically improved over the decades -- with cars potentially boasting complex LiDAR and vision systems and with a growing expansion of the available body of dedicated datasets for this newly available information -- not much work has been done to harness these novel signals for the core problem of 3D human pose estimation. Our method, which we coin HUM3DIL (HUMan 3D from Images and LiDAR), efficiently makes use of these complementary signals, in a semi-supervised fashion and outperforms existing methods with a large margin. It is a fast and compact model for onboard deployment. Specifically, we embed LiDAR points into pixel-aligned multi-modal features, which we pass through a sequence of Transformer refinement stages. Quantitative experiments on the Waymo Open Dataset support these claims, where we achieve state-of-the-art results on the task of 3D pose estimation.

 - **Abstract**
 Deep reinforcement learning has recently emerged as an appealing alternative for legged locomotion over multiple terrains by training a policy in physical simulation and then transferring it to the real world (i.e., sim-to-real transfer). Despite considerable progress, the capacity and scalability of traditional neural networks are still limited, which may hinder their applications in more complex environments. In contrast, the Transformer architecture has shown its superiority in a wide range of large-scale sequence modeling tasks, including natural language processing and decision-making problems. In this paper, we propose Terrain Transformer (TERT), a high-capacity Transformer model for quadrupedal locomotion control on various terrains. Furthermore, to better leverage Transformer in sim-to-real scenarios, we present a novel two-stage training framework consisting of an offline pretraining stage and an online correction stage, which can naturally integrate Transformer with privileged training. Extensive experiments in simulation demonstrate that TERT outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on different terrains in terms of return, energy consumption and control smoothness. In further real-world validation, TERT successfully traverses nine challenging terrains, including sand pit and stair down, which can not be accomplished by strong baselines.

 - **Abstract**
 Time series, sets of sequences in chronological order, are essential data in statistical research with many forecasting applications. Although recent performance in many Transformer-based models has been noticeable, long multi-horizon time series forecasting remains a very challenging task. Going beyond transformers in sequence translation and transduction research, we observe the effects of down-and-up samplings that can nudge temporal saliency patterns to emerge in time sequences. Motivated by the mentioned observation, in this paper, we propose a novel architecture, Temporal Saliency Detection (TSD), on top of the attention mechanism and apply it to multi-horizon time series prediction. We renovate the traditional encoder-decoder architecture by making as a series of deep convolutional blocks to work in tandem with the multi-head self-attention. The proposed TSD approach facilitates the multiresolution of saliency patterns upon condensed multi-heads, thus progressively enhancing complex time series forecasting. Experimental results illustrate that our proposed approach has significantly outperformed existing state-of-the-art methods across multiple standard benchmark datasets in many far-horizon forecasting settings. Overall, TSD achieves 31% and 46% relative improvement over the current state-of-the-art models in multivariate and univariate time series forecasting scenarios on standard benchmarks.

 - **Abstract**
 Dense retrieval aims to map queries and passages into low-dimensional vector space for efficient similarity measuring, showing promising effectiveness in various large-scale retrieval tasks. Since most existing methods commonly adopt pre-trained Transformers (e.g. BERT) for parameter initialization, some work focuses on proposing new pre-training tasks for compressing the useful semantic information from passages into dense vectors, achieving remarkable performances. However, it is still challenging to effectively capture the rich semantic information and relations about passages into the dense vectors via one single particular pre-training task. In this work, we propose a multi-task pre-trained model, MASTER, that unifies and integrates multiple pre-training tasks with different learning objectives under the bottlenecked masked autoencoder architecture. Concretely, MASTER utilizes a multi-decoder architecture to integrate three types of pre-training tasks: corrupted passages recovering, related passage recovering and PLMs outputs recovering. By incorporating a shared deep encoder, we construct a representation bottleneck in our architecture, compressing the abundant semantic information across tasks into dense vectors. The first two types of tasks concentrate on capturing the semantic information of passages and relationships among them within the pre-training corpus. The third one can capture the knowledge beyond the corpus from external PLMs (e.g. GPT-2). Extensive experiments on several large-scale passage retrieval datasets have shown that our approach outperforms the previous state-of-the-art dense retrieval methods. Our code and data are publicly released in https://github.com/microsoft/SimXNS

 3D object detection with surround-view images is an essential task for autonomous driving. In this work, we propose DETR4D, a Transformer-based framework that explores sparse attention and direct feature query for 3D object detection in multi-view images. We design a novel projective cross-attention mechanism for query-image interaction to address the limitations of existing methods in terms of geometric cue exploitation and information loss for cross-view objects. In addition, we introduce a heatmap generation technique that bridges 3D and 2D spaces efficiently via query initialization. Furthermore, unlike the common practice of fusing intermediate spatial features for temporal aggregation, we provide a new perspective by introducing a novel hybrid approach that performs cross-frame fusion over past object queries and image features, enabling efficient and robust modeling of temporal information. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed DETR4D.

 - **Abstract**
 Transformers have proved to be very effective for visual recognition tasks. In particular, vision transformers construct compressed global representations through self-attention and learnable class tokens. Multi-resolution transformers have shown recent successes in semantic segmentation but can only capture local interactions in high-resolution feature maps. This paper extends the notion of global tokens to build GLobal Attention Multi-resolution (GLAM) transformers. GLAM is a generic module that can be integrated into most existing transformer backbones. GLAM includes learnable global tokens, which unlike previous methods can model interactions between all image regions, and extracts powerful representations during training. Extensive experiments show that GLAM-Swin or GLAM-Swin-UNet exhibit substantially better performances than their vanilla counterparts on ADE20K and Cityscapes. Moreover, GLAM can be used to segment large 3D medical images, and GLAM-nnFormer achieves new state-of-the-art performance on the BCV dataset.

 Many prior language modeling efforts have shown that pre-training on an in-domain corpus can significantly improve performance on downstream domain-specific NLP tasks. How- ever, the difficulties associated with collecting enough in-domain data might discourage researchers from approaching this pre-training task. In this paper, we conducted a series of experiments by pre-training Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) with different sizes of biomedical corpora. The results demonstrate that pre-training on a relatively small amount of in-domain data (4GB) with limited training steps, can lead to better performance on downstream domain-specific NLP tasks compared with fine-tuning models pre-trained on general corpora

 - **Abstract**
 Vision transformers (ViTs) have achieved impressive results on various computer vision tasks in the last several years. In this work, we study the capability of frozen ViTs, pretrained only on visual data, to generalize to audio-visual data without finetuning any of its original parameters. To do so, we propose a latent audio-visual hybrid (LAVISH) adapter that adapts pretrained ViTs to audio-visual tasks by injecting a small number of trainable parameters into every layer of a frozen ViT. To efficiently fuse visual and audio cues, our LAVISH adapter uses a small set of latent tokens, which form an attention bottleneck, thus, eliminating the quadratic cost of standard cross-attention. Compared to the existing modality-specific audio-visual methods, our approach achieves competitive or even better performance on various audio-visual tasks while using fewer tunable parameters and without relying on costly audio pretraining or external audio encoders.

 - **Abstract**
 Vision Transformers convert images to sequences by slicing them into patches. The size of these patches controls a speed/accuracy tradeoff, with smaller patches leading to higher accuracy at greater computational cost, but changing the patch size typically requires retraining the model. In this paper, we demonstrate that simply randomizing the patch size at training time leads to a single set of weights that performs well across a wide range of patch sizes, making it possible to tailor the model to different compute budgets at deployment time. We extensively evaluate the resulting model, which we call FlexiViT, on a wide range of tasks, including classification, image-text retrieval, open-world detection, panoptic segmentation, and semantic segmentation, concluding that it usually matches, and sometimes outperforms, standard ViT models trained at a single patch size in an otherwise identical setup. Hence, FlexiViT training is a simple drop-in improvement for ViT that makes it easy to add compute-adaptive capabilities to most models relying on a ViT backbone architecture.

 - **Abstract**
 Multimodal models are becoming increasingly effective, in part due to unified components, such as the Transformer architecture. However, multimodal models still often consist of many task- and modality-specific pieces and training procedures. For example, CLIP (Radford et al., 2021) trains independent text and image towers via a contrastive loss. We explore an additional unification: the use of a pure pixel-based model to perform image, text, and multimodal tasks. Our model is trained with contrastive loss alone, so we call it CLIP-Pixels Only (CLIPPO). CLIPPO uses a single encoder that processes both regular images and text rendered as images. CLIPPO performs image-based tasks such as retrieval and zero-shot image classification almost as well as CLIP, with half the number of parameters and no text-specific tower or embedding. When trained jointly via image-text contrastive learning and next-sentence contrastive learning, CLIPPO can perform well on natural language understanding tasks, without any word-level loss (language modelling or masked language modelling), outperforming pixel-based prior work. Surprisingly, CLIPPO can obtain good accuracy in visual question answering, simply by rendering the question and image together. Finally, we exploit the fact that CLIPPO does not require a tokenizer to show that it can achieve strong performance on multilingual multimodal retrieval without

 - **Abstract**
 With the success of Vision Transformers (ViTs) in computer vision tasks, recent arts try to optimize the performance and complexity of ViTs to enable efficient deployment on mobile devices. Multiple approaches are proposed to accelerate attention mechanism, improve inefficient designs, or incorporate mobile-friendly lightweight convolutions to form hybrid architectures. However, ViT and its variants still have higher latency or considerably more parameters than lightweight CNNs, even true for the years-old MobileNet. In practice, latency and size are both crucial for efficient deployment on resource-constraint hardware. In this work, we investigate a central question, can transformer models run as fast as MobileNet and maintain a similar size? We revisit the design choices of ViTs and propose an improved supernet with low latency and high parameter efficiency. We further introduce a fine-grained joint search strategy that can find efficient architectures by optimizing latency and number of parameters simultaneously. The proposed models, EfficientFormerV2, achieve about $4\%$ higher top-1 accuracy than MobileNetV2 and MobileNetV2$\times1.4$ on ImageNet-1K with similar latency and parameters. We demonstrate that properly designed and optimized vision transformers can achieve high performance with MobileNet-level size and speed.

 - **Abstract**
 Optimization in multi-task learning (MTL) is more challenging than single-task learning (STL), as the gradient from different tasks can be contradictory. When tasks are related, it can be beneficial to share some parameters among them (cooperation). However, some tasks require additional parameters with expertise in a specific type of data or discrimination (specialization). To address the MTL challenge, we propose Mod-Squad, a new model that is Modularized into groups of experts (a 'Squad'). This structure allows us to formalize cooperation and specialization as the process of matching experts and tasks. We optimize this matching process during the training of a single model. Specifically, we incorporate mixture of experts (MoE) layers into a transformer model, with a new loss that incorporates the mutual dependence between tasks and experts. As a result, only a small set of experts are activated for each task. This prevents the sharing of the entire backbone model between all tasks, which strengthens the model, especially when the training set size and the number of tasks scale up. More interestingly, for each task, we can extract the small set of experts as a standalone model that maintains the same performance as the large model. Extensive experiments on the Taskonomy dataset with 13 vision tasks and the PASCAL-Context dataset with 5 vision tasks show the superiority of our approach.

 - **Abstract**
 With the success of neural volume rendering in novel view synthesis, neural implicit reconstruction with volume rendering has become popular. However, most methods optimize per-scene functions and are unable to generalize to novel scenes. We introduce VolRecon, a generalizable implicit reconstruction method with Signed Ray Distance Function (SRDF). To reconstruct with fine details and little noise, we combine projection features, aggregated from multi-view features with a view transformer, and volume features interpolated from a coarse global feature volume. A ray transformer computes SRDF values of all the samples along a ray to estimate the surface location, which are used for volume rendering of color and depth. Extensive experiments on DTU and ETH3D demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization ability of our method. On DTU, our method outperforms SparseNeuS by about 30% in sparse view reconstruction and achieves comparable quality as MVSNet in full view reconstruction. Besides, our method shows good generalization ability on the large-scale ETH3D benchmark. Project page: https://fangjinhuawang.github.io/VolRecon.

 - **Abstract**
 Deep learning models are being increasingly applied to imbalanced data in high stakes fields such as medicine, autonomous driving, and intelligence analysis. Imbalanced data compounds the black-box nature of deep networks because the relationships between classes may be highly skewed and unclear. This can reduce trust by model users and hamper the progress of developers of imbalanced learning algorithms. Existing methods that investigate imbalanced data complexity are geared toward binary classification, shallow learning models and low dimensional data. In addition, current eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques mainly focus on converting opaque deep learning models into simpler models (e.g., decision trees) or mapping predictions for specific instances to inputs, instead of examining global data properties and complexities. Therefore, there is a need for a framework that is tailored to modern deep networks, that incorporates large, high dimensional, multi-class datasets, and uncovers data complexities commonly found in imbalanced data (e.g., class overlap, sub-concepts, and outlier instances). We propose a set of techniques that can be used by both deep learning model users to identify, visualize and understand class prototypes, sub-concepts and outlier instances; and by imbalanced learning algorithm developers to detect features and class exemplars that are key to model performance. Our framework also identifies instances that reside on the border of class decision boundaries, which can carry highly discriminative information. Unlike many existing XAI techniques which map model decisions to gray-scale pixel locations, we use saliency through back-propagation to identify and aggregate image color bands across entire classes. Our framework is publicly available at \url{https://github.com/dd1github/XAI_for_Imbalanced_Learning}

 - **Abstract**
 Conventional cameras capture image irradiance on a sensor and convert it to RGB images using an image signal processor (ISP). The images can then be used for photography or visual computing tasks in a variety of applications, such as public safety surveillance and autonomous driving. One can argue that since RAW images contain all the captured information, the conversion of RAW to RGB using an ISP is not necessary for visual computing. In this paper, we propose a novel $\rho$-Vision framework to perform high-level semantic understanding and low-level compression using RAW images without the ISP subsystem used for decades. Considering the scarcity of available RAW image datasets, we first develop an unpaired CycleR2R network based on unsupervised CycleGAN to train modular unrolled ISP and inverse ISP (invISP) models using unpaired RAW and RGB images. We can then flexibly generate simulated RAW images (simRAW) using any existing RGB image dataset and finetune different models originally trained for the RGB domain to process real-world camera RAW images. We demonstrate object detection and image compression capabilities in RAW-domain using RAW-domain YOLOv3 and RAW image compressor (RIC) on snapshots from various cameras. Quantitative results reveal that RAW-domain task inference provides better detection accuracy and compression compared to RGB-domain processing. Furthermore, the proposed \r{ho}-Vision generalizes across various camera sensors and different task-specific models. Additional advantages of the proposed $\rho$-Vision that eliminates the ISP are the potential reductions in computations and processing times.
