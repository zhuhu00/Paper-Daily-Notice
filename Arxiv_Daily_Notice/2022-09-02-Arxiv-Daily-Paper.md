 - **Abstract**
 We propose X-NeRF, a novel method to learn a Cross-Spectral scene representation given images captured from cameras with different light spectrum sensitivity, based on the Neural Radiance Fields formulation. X-NeRF optimizes camera poses across spectra during training and exploits Normalized Cross-Device Coordinates (NXDC) to render images of different modalities from arbitrary viewpoints, which are aligned and at the same resolution. Experiments on 16 forward-facing scenes, featuring color, multi-spectral and infrared images, confirm the effectiveness of X-NeRF at modeling Cross-Spectral scene representations.

 - **Abstract**
 In 2020 the Australia New Zealand Standard Research Classification Fields of Research Codes (ANZSRC FoR codes) were updated by their owners. This has led the sector to need to update their systems of reference and has caused suppliers working in the research information sphere to need to update both systems and data. This paper describes the approach developed by Digital Science's Dimensions team to the creation of an improved machine learning training set, and the mapping of that set from FoR 2008 codes to FoR 2020 codes so that Dimensions classification approach for the ANZSRC codes could be improved and updated.

 - **Abstract**
 One of the main methods for semantic interpretation of text is mapping it into a vector in some embedding space. Such vectors can then be used for a variety of text processing tasks. Recently, most embedding spaces are a product of training large language models. One major drawback of this type of representation is its incomprehensibility to humans. Understanding the embedding space is crucial for several important needs, including the need to explain the decision of a system that uses the embedding, the need to debug the embedding method and compare it to alternatives, and the need to detect biases hidden in the model. In this paper, we present a novel method of transforming any embedding space into a comprehensible conceptual space. We first present an algorithm for deriving a conceptual space with dynamic on-demand granularity. We then show a method for transferring any vector in the original incomprehensible space to an understandable vector in the conceptual space. We combine human tests with cross-model tests to show that the conceptualized vectors indeed represent the semantics of the original vectors. We also show how the conceptualized vectors can be used for various tasks including identifying weaknesses in the semantics underlying the original spaces and differences in the semantics of alternative models.

 - **Abstract**
 To mitigate the effects of undesired biases in models, several approaches propose to pre-process the input dataset to reduce the risks of discrimination by preventing the inference of sensitive attributes. Unfortunately, most of these pre-processing methods lead to the generation a new distribution that is very different from the original one, thus often leading to unrealistic data. As a side effect, this new data distribution implies that existing models need to be re-trained to be able to make accurate predictions. To address this issue, we propose a novel pre-processing method, that we coin as fair mapping, based on the transformation of the distribution of protected groups onto a chosen target one, with additional privacy constraints whose objective is to prevent the inference of sensitive attributes. More precisely, we leverage on the recent works of the Wasserstein GAN and AttGAN frameworks to achieve the optimal transport of data points coupled with a discriminator enforcing the protection against attribute inference. Our proposed approach, preserves the interpretability of data and can be used without defining exactly the sensitive groups. In addition, our approach can be specialized to model existing state-of-the-art approaches, thus proposing a unifying view on these methods. Finally, several experiments on real and synthetic datasets demonstrate that our approach is able to hide the sensitive attributes, while limiting the distortion of the data and improving the fairness on subsequent data analysis tasks.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper introduces a unified framework for video action segmentation via sequence to sequence (seq2seq) translation in a fully and timestamp supervised setup. In contrast to current state-of-the-art frame-level prediction methods, we view action segmentation as a seq2seq translation task, i.e., mapping a sequence of video frames to a sequence of action segments. Our proposed method involves a series of modifications and auxiliary loss functions on the standard Transformer seq2seq translation model to cope with long input sequences opposed to short output sequences and relatively few videos. We incorporate an auxiliary supervision signal for the encoder via a frame-wise loss and propose a separate alignment decoder for an implicit duration prediction. Finally, we extend our framework to the timestamp supervised setting via our proposed constrained k-medoids algorithm to generate pseudo-segmentations. Our proposed framework performs consistently on both fully and timestamp supervised settings, outperforming or competing state-of-the-art on several datasets.

 - **Abstract**
 The point cloud based 3D single object tracking (3DSOT) has drawn increasing attention. Lots of breakthroughs have been made, but we also reveal two severe issues. By an extensive analysis, we find the prediction manner of current approaches is non-robust, i.e., exposing a misalignment gap between prediction score and actually localization accuracy. Another issue is the sparse point returns will damage the feature matching procedure of the SOT task. Based on these insights, we introduce two novel modules, i.e., Adaptive Refine Prediction (ARP) and Target Knowledge Transfer (TKT), to tackle them, respectively. To this end, we first design a strong pipeline to extract discriminative features and conduct the matching procedure with the attention mechanism. Then, ARP module is proposed to tackle the misalignment issue by aggregating all predicted candidates with valuable clues. Finally, TKT module is designed to effectively overcome incomplete point cloud due to sparse and occlusion issues. We call our overall framework PCET. By conducting extensive experiments on the KITTI and Waymo Open Dataset, our model achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining a lower computational consumption.

 - **Abstract**
 Robots and intelligent systems that sense or interact with the world are increasingly being used to automate a wide array of tasks. The ability of these systems to complete these tasks depends on a large range of technologies such as the mechanical and electrical parts that make up the physical body of the robot and its sensors, perception algorithms to perceive the environment, and planning and control algorithms to produce meaningful actions. Therefore, it is often necessary to consider the interactions between these components when designing an embodied system. This thesis explores work on the task-driven co-optimization of robotics systems in an end-to-end manner, simultaneously optimizing the physical components of the system with inference or control algorithms directly for task performance. We start by considering the problem of optimizing a beacon-based localization system directly for localization accuracy. Designing such a system involves placing beacons throughout the environment and inferring location from sensor readings. In our work, we develop a deep learning approach to optimize both beacon placement and location inference directly for localization accuracy. We then turn our attention to the related problem of task-driven optimization of robots and their controllers. In our work, we start by proposing a data-efficient algorithm based on multi-task reinforcement learning. Our approach efficiently optimizes both physical design and control parameters directly for task performance by leveraging a design-conditioned controller capable of generalizing over the space of physical designs. We then follow this up with an extension to allow for the optimization over discrete morphological parameters such as the number and configuration of limbs. Finally, we conclude by exploring the fabrication and deployment of optimized soft robots.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.00260
 - **Abstract**
 Conformer has achieved impressive results in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) by leveraging transformer's capturing of content-based global interactions and convolutional neural network's exploiting of local features. In Conformer, two macaron-like feed-forward layers with half-step residual connections sandwich the multi-head self-attention and convolution modules followed by a post layer normalization. We improve Conformer's long-sequence representation ability in two directions, \emph{sparser} and \emph{deeper}. We adapt a sparse self-attention mechanism with $\mathcal{O}(L\text{log}L)$ in time complexity and memory usage. A deep normalization strategy is utilized when performing residual connections to ensure our training of hundred-level Conformer blocks. On the Japanese CSJ-500h dataset, this deep sparse Conformer achieves respectively CERs of 5.52\%, 4.03\% and 4.50\% on the three evaluation sets and 4.16\%, 2.84\% and 3.20\% when ensembling five deep sparse Conformer variants from 12 to 16, 17, 50, and finally 100 encoder layers.

 - **Abstract**
 Cybersecurity has become a primary global concern with the rapid increase in security attacks and data breaches. Artificial intelligence is promising to help humans analyzing and identifying attacks. However, labeling millions of packets for supervised learning is never easy. This study aims to leverage transfer learning technique that stores the knowledge gained from well-defined attack lifecycle documents and applies it to hundred thousands of unlabeled attacks (packets) for identifying their attack tactics. We anticipate the knowledge of an attack is well-described in the documents, and the cutting edge transformer-based language model can embed the knowledge into a high-dimensional latent space. Then, reusing the information from the language model for the learning of attack tactic carried by packets to improve the learning efficiency. We propose a system, PELAT, that fine-tunes BERT model with 1,417 articles from MITRE ATT&CK lifecycle framework to enhance its attack knowledge (including syntax used and semantic meanings embedded). PELAT then transfers its knowledge to perform semi-supervised learning for unlabeled packets to generate their tactic labels. Further, when a new attack packet arrives, the packet payload will be processed by the PELAT language model with a downstream classifier to predict its tactics. In this way, we can effectively reduce the burden of manually labeling big datasets. In a one-week honeypot attack dataset (227 thousand packets per day), PELAT performs 99% of precision, recall, and F1 on testing dataset. PELAT can infer over 99% of tactics on two other testing datasets (while nearly 90% of tactics are identified).

 - **Abstract**
 We present a novel generative method for the creation of city-scale road layouts. While the output of recent methods is limited in both size of the covered area and diversity, our framework produces large traversable graphs of high quality consisting of vertices and edges representing complete street networks covering 400 square kilometers or more. While our framework can process general 2D embedded graphs, we focus on street networks due to the wide availability of training data. Our generative framework consists of a transformer decoder that is used in a sliding window manner to predict a field of indices, with each index encoding a representation of the local neighborhood. The semantics of each index is determined by a dictionary of context vectors. The index field is then input to a decoder to compute the street graph. Using data from OpenStreetMap, we train our system on whole cities and even across large countries such as the US, and finally compare it to the state of the art.

 - **Abstract**
 Creating a complex work of art like music necessitates profound creativity. With recent advancements in deep learning and powerful models such as transformers, there has been huge progress in automatic music generation. In an accompaniment generation context, creating a coherent drum pattern with apposite fills and improvisations at proper locations in a song is a challenging task even for an experienced drummer. Drum beats tend to follow a repetitive pattern through stanzas with fills or improvisation at section boundaries. In this work, we tackle the task of drum pattern generation conditioned on the accompanying music played by four melodic instruments: Piano, Guitar, Bass, and Strings. We use the transformer sequence to sequence model to generate a basic drum pattern conditioned on the melodic accompaniment to find that improvisation is largely absent, attributed possibly to its expectedly relatively low representation in the training data. We propose a novelty function to capture the extent of improvisation in a bar relative to its neighbors. We train a model to predict improvisation locations from the melodic accompaniment tracks. Finally, we use a novel BERT-inspired in-filling architecture, to learn the structure of both the drums and melody to in-fill elements of improvised music.

 - **Abstract**
 Text-based motion generation models are drawing a surge of interest for their potential for automating the motion-making process in the game, animation, or robot industries. In this paper, we propose a diffusion-based motion synthesis and editing model named FLAME. Inspired by the recent successes in diffusion models, we integrate diffusion-based generative models into the motion domain. FLAME can generate high-fidelity motions well aligned with the given text. Also, it can edit the parts of the motion, both frame-wise and joint-wise, without any fine-tuning. FLAME involves a new transformer-based architecture we devise to better handle motion data, which is found to be crucial to manage variable-length motions and well attend to free-form text. In experiments, we show that FLAME achieves state-of-the-art generation performances on three text-motion datasets: HumanML3D, BABEL, and KIT. We also demonstrate that editing capability of FLAME can be extended to other tasks such as motion prediction or motion in-betweening, which have been previously covered by dedicated models.

 - **Abstract**
 Automatic extraction of funding information from academic articles adds significant value to industry and research communities, such as tracking research outcomes by funding organizations, profiling researchers and universities based on the received funding, and supporting open access policies. Two major challenges of identifying and linking funding entities are: (i) sparse graph structure of the Knowledge Base (KB), which makes the commonly used graph-based entity linking approaches suboptimal for the funding domain, (ii) missing entities in KB, which (unlike recent zero-shot approaches) requires marking entity mentions without KB entries as NIL. We propose an entity linking model that can perform NIL prediction and overcome data scarcity issues in a time and data-efficient manner. Our model builds on a transformer-based mention detection and bi-encoder model to perform entity linking. We show that our model outperforms strong existing baselines.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.00383
 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we describe a graph-based algorithm that uses the features obtained by a self-supervised transformer to detect and segment salient objects in images and videos. With this approach, the image patches that compose an image or video are organised into a fully connected graph, where the edge between each pair of patches is labeled with a similarity score between patches using features learned by the transformer. Detection and segmentation of salient objects is then formulated as a graph-cut problem and solved using the classical Normalized Cut algorithm. Despite the simplicity of this approach, it achieves state-of-the-art results on several common image and video detection and segmentation tasks. For unsupervised object discovery, this approach outperforms the competing approaches by a margin of 6.1%, 5.7%, and 2.6%, respectively, when tested with the VOC07, VOC12, and COCO20K datasets. For the unsupervised saliency detection task in images, this method improves the score for Intersection over Union (IoU) by 4.4%, 5.6% and 5.2%. When tested with the ECSSD, DUTS, and DUT-OMRON datasets, respectively, compared to current state-of-the-art techniques. This method also achieves competitive results for unsupervised video object segmentation tasks with the DAVIS, SegTV2, and FBMS datasets.

 - **Abstract**
 Fu and Tantithamthavorn have recently proposed GPT2SP, a Transformer-based deep learning model for SP estimation of user stories. They empirically evaluated the performance of GPT2SP on a dataset shared by Choetkiertikul et al including 16 projects with a total of 23,313 issues. They benchmarked GPT2SP against two baselines (namely the naive Mean and Median estimators) and the method previously proposed by Choetkiertikul et al. (which we will refer to as DL2SP from now on) for both within- and cross-project estimation scenarios, and evaluated the extent to which each components of GPT2SP contribute towards the accuracy of the SP estimates. Their results show that GPT2SP outperforms DL2SP with a 6%-47% improvement over MAE for the within-project scenario and a 3%-46% improvement for the cross-project scenarios. However, when we attempted to use the GPT2SP source code made available by Fu and Tantithamthavorn to reproduce their experiments, we found a bug in the computation of the Mean Absolute Error (MAE), which may have inflated the GPT2SP's accuracy reported in their work. Therefore, we had issued a pull request to fix such a bug, which has been accepted and merged into their repository at https://github.com/awsm-research/gpt2sp/pull/2. In this report, we describe the results we achieved by using the fixed version of GPT2SP to replicate the experiments conducted in the original paper for RQ1 and RQ2. Following the original study, we analyse the results considering the Medan Absolute Error (MAE) of the estimation methods over all issues in each project, but we also report the Median Absolute Error (MdAE) and the Standard accuracy (SA) for completeness.

 - **Abstract**
 Like many team sports, basketball involves two groups of players who engage in collaborative and adversarial activities to win a game. Players and teams are executing various complex strategies to gain an advantage over their opponents. Defining, identifying, and analyzing different types of activities is an important task in sports analytics, as it can lead to better strategies and decisions by the players and coaching staff. The objective of this paper is to automatically recognize basketball group activities from tracking data representing locations of players and the ball during a game. We propose a novel deep learning approach for group activity recognition (GAR) in team sports called NETS. To efficiently model the player relations in team sports, we combined a Transformer-based architecture with LSTM embedding, and a team-wise pooling layer to recognize the group activity. Training such a neural network generally requires a large amount of annotated data, which incurs high labeling cost. To address scarcity of manual labels, we generate weak-labels and pretrain the neural network on a self-supervised trajectory prediction task. We used a large tracking data set from 632 NBA games to evaluate our approach. The results show that NETS is capable of learning group activities with high accuracy, and that self- and weak-supervised training in NETS have a positive impact on GAR accuracy.

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.00495
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.00495
 - **Abstract**
 Social media platforms give rise to an abundance of posts and comments on every topic imaginable. Many of these posts express opinions on various aspects of society, but their unfalsifiable nature makes them ill-suited to fact-checking pipelines. In this work, we aim to distill such posts into a small set of narratives that capture the essential claims related to a given topic. Understanding and visualizing these narratives can facilitate more informed debates on social media. As a first step towards systematically identifying the underlying narratives on social media, we introduce PAPYER, a fine-grained dataset of online comments related to hygiene in public restrooms, which contains a multitude of unfalsifiable claims. We present a human-in-the-loop pipeline that uses a combination of machine and human kernels to discover the prevailing narratives and show that this pipeline outperforms recent large transformer models and state-of-the-art unsupervised topic models.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.00557
 - **Abstract**
 The processing of legal texts has been developing as an emerging field in natural language processing (NLP). Legal texts contain unique jargon and complex linguistic attributes in vocabulary, semantics, syntax, and morphology. Therefore, the development of text simplification (TS) methods specific to the legal domain is of paramount importance for facilitating comprehension of legal text by ordinary people and providing inputs to high-level models for mainstream legal NLP applications. While a recent study proposed a rule-based TS method for legal text, learning-based TS in the legal domain has not been considered previously. Here we introduce an unsupervised simplification method for legal texts (USLT). USLT performs domain-specific TS by replacing complex words and splitting long sentences. To this end, USLT detects complex words in a sentence, generates candidates via a masked-transformer model, and selects a candidate for substitution based on a rank score. Afterward, USLT recursively decomposes long sentences into a hierarchy of shorter core and context sentences while preserving semantic meaning. We demonstrate that USLT outperforms state-of-the-art domain-general TS methods in text simplicity while keeping the semantics intact.

 - **Abstract**
 Extracting temporal relationships between pairs of events in texts is a crucial yet challenging problem for natural language understanding. Depending on the distance between the events, models must learn to differently balance information from local and global contexts surrounding the event pair for temporal relation prediction. Learning how to fuse this information has proved challenging for transformer-based language models. Therefore, we present MulCo: Multi-Scale Contrastive Co-Training, a technique for the better fusion of local and global contextualized features. Our model uses a BERT-based language model to encode local context and a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to represent global document-level syntactic and temporal characteristics. Unlike previous state-of-the-art methods, which use simple concatenation on multi-view features or select optimal sentences using sophisticated reinforcement learning approaches, our model co-trains GNN and BERT modules using a multi-scale contrastive learning objective. The GNN and BERT modules learn a synergistic parameterization by contrasting GNN multi-layer multi-hop subgraphs (i.e., global context embeddings) and BERT outputs (i.e., local context embeddings) through end-to-end back-propagation. We empirically demonstrate that MulCo provides improved ability to fuse local and global contexts encoded using BERT and GNN compared to the current state-of-the-art. Our experimental results show that MulCo achieves new state-of-the-art results on several temporal relation extraction datasets.

 - **Abstract**
 Deep reinforcement learning agents are notoriously sample inefficient, which considerably limits their application to real-world problems. Recently, many model-based methods have been designed to address this issue, with learning in the imagination of a world model being one of the most prominent approaches. However, while virtually unlimited interaction with a simulated environment sounds appealing, the world model has to be accurate over extended periods of time. Motivated by the success of Transformers in sequence modeling tasks, we introduce IRIS, a data-efficient agent that learns in a world model composed of a discrete autoencoder and an autoregressive Transformer. With the equivalent of only two hours of gameplay in the Atari 100k benchmark, IRIS achieves a mean human normalized score of 1.046, and outperforms humans on 10 out of 26 games. Our approach sets a new state of the art for methods without lookahead search, and even surpasses MuZero. To foster future research on Transformers and world models for sample-efficient reinforcement learning, we release our codebase at https://github.com/eloialonso/iris.

 - **Abstract**
 As its core computation, a self-attention mechanism gauges pairwise correlations across the entire input sequence. Despite favorable performance, calculating pairwise correlations is prohibitively costly. While recent work has shown the benefits of runtime pruning of elements with low attention scores, the quadratic complexity of self-attention mechanisms and their on-chip memory capacity demands are overlooked. This work addresses these constraints by architecting an accelerator, called SPRINT, which leverages the inherent parallelism of ReRAM crossbar arrays to compute attention scores in an approximate manner. Our design prunes the low attention scores using a lightweight analog thresholding circuitry within ReRAM, enabling SPRINT to fetch only a small subset of relevant data to on-chip memory. To mitigate potential negative repercussions for model accuracy, SPRINT re-computes the attention scores for the few fetched data in digital. The combined in-memory pruning and on-chip recompute of the relevant attention scores enables SPRINT to transform quadratic complexity to a merely linear one. In addition, we identify and leverage a dynamic spatial locality between the adjacent attention operations even after pruning, which eliminates costly yet redundant data fetches. We evaluate our proposed technique on a wide range of state-of-the-art transformer models. On average, SPRINT yields 7.5x speedup and 19.6x energy reduction when total 16KB on-chip memory is used, while virtually on par with iso-accuracy of the baseline models (on average 0.36% degradation).

 - **Abstract**
 Ad relevance modeling plays a critical role in online advertising systems including Microsoft Bing. To leverage powerful transformers like BERT in this low-latency setting, many existing approaches perform ad-side computations offline. While efficient, these approaches are unable to serve cold start ads, resulting in poor relevance predictions for such ads. This work aims to design a new, low-latency BERT via structured pruning to empower real-time online inference for cold start ads relevance on a CPU platform. Our challenge is that previous methods typically prune all layers of the transformer to a high, uniform sparsity, thereby producing models which cannot achieve satisfactory inference speed with an acceptable accuracy. In this paper, we propose SwiftPruner - an efficient framework that leverages evolution-based search to automatically find the best-performing layer-wise sparse BERT model under the desired latency constraint. Different from existing evolution algorithms that conduct random mutations, we propose a reinforced mutator with a latency-aware multi-objective reward to conduct better mutations for efficiently searching the large space of layer-wise sparse models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently achieves higher ROC AUC and lower latency than the uniform sparse baseline and state-of-the-art search methods. Remarkably, under our latency requirement of 1900us on CPU, SwiftPruner achieves a 0.86% higher AUC than the state-of-the-art uniform sparse baseline for BERT-Mini on a large scale real-world dataset. Online A/B testing shows that our model also achieves a significant 11.7% cut in the ratio of defective cold start ads with satisfactory real-time serving latency.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper introduces a unified framework for video action segmentation via sequence to sequence (seq2seq) translation in a fully and timestamp supervised setup. In contrast to current state-of-the-art frame-level prediction methods, we view action segmentation as a seq2seq translation task, i.e., mapping a sequence of video frames to a sequence of action segments. Our proposed method involves a series of modifications and auxiliary loss functions on the standard Transformer seq2seq translation model to cope with long input sequences opposed to short output sequences and relatively few videos. We incorporate an auxiliary supervision signal for the encoder via a frame-wise loss and propose a separate alignment decoder for an implicit duration prediction. Finally, we extend our framework to the timestamp supervised setting via our proposed constrained k-medoids algorithm to generate pseudo-segmentations. Our proposed framework performs consistently on both fully and timestamp supervised settings, outperforming or competing state-of-the-art on several datasets.

 - **Abstract**
 Predicting the possible future trajectories of the surrounding dynamic agents is an essential requirement in autonomous driving. These trajectories mainly depend on the surrounding static environment, as well as the past movements of those dynamic agents. Furthermore, the multimodal nature of agent intentions makes the trajectory prediction problem more challenging. All of the existing models consider the target agent as well as the surrounding agents similarly, without considering the variation of physical properties. In this paper, we present a novel deep-learning based framework for multimodal trajectory prediction in autonomous driving, which considers the physical properties of the target and surrounding vehicles such as the object class and their physical dimensions through a weighted attention module, that improves the accuracy of the predictions. Our model has achieved the highest results in the nuScenes trajectory prediction benchmark, out of the models which use rasterized maps to input environment information. Furthermore, our model is able to run in real-time, achieving a high inference rate of over 300 FPS.

 - **Abstract**
 Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are nowadays often employed in vision-based perception stacks for safetycritical applications such as autonomous driving or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). Due to the safety requirements in those use cases, it is important to know the limitations of the CNN and, thus, to detect Out-of-Distribution (OOD) samples. In this work, we present an approach to enable OOD detection for 2D object detection by employing the margin entropy (ME) loss. The proposed method is easy to implement and can be applied to most existing object detection architectures. In addition, we introduce Separability as a metric for detecting OOD samples in object detection. We show that a CNN trained with the ME loss significantly outperforms OOD detection using standard confidence scores. At the same time, the runtime of the underlying object detection framework remains constant rendering the ME loss a powerful tool to enable OOD detection.
