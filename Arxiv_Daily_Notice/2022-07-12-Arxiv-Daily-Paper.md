 - **Abstract**
 Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) algorithms are frequently deployed to support a wide range of robotics applications, such as autonomous navigation in unknown environments, and scene mapping in virtual reality. Many of these applications require the autonomous agents performing SLAM with highly dynamic objects in the scene. To this end, this tutorial extends a recently introduced, unifying optimization-based SLAM backend framework to environments with moving objects and features. Using this framework, we consider a rapprochement of recent advances in dynamic SLAM. Moreover, we present a novel, filtering-based dynamic SLAM algorithm, named dynamic EKF SLAM within our framework, and prove that it is mathematically equivalent to a direct extension of the classical EKF SLAM algorithm to the dynamic environment setting. Empirical results with simulated data indicate that dynamic EKF SLAM can achieve high localization and mobile object pose estimation accuracy, as well as high map precision.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent 3D registration methods can effectively handle large-scale or partially overlapping point pairs. However, despite its practicality, matching the unbalanced pairs in terms of spatial scale and density has been overlooked. We present a novel 3D registration method, called UPPNet, for the unbalanced point pairs. We propose a hierarchical framework to find inlier correspondences effectively by gradually reducing search space. Our method predicts the subregions of the target points likely to be overlapped with the query points. The following super-point matching module and fine-grained refinement module estimate accurate inlier correspondences between two point clouds. Furthermore, we apply geometric constraints to refine the correspondences that satisfy spatial compatibility. Correspondence prediction is trained end-to-end, and our approach can predict the proper rigid transformation with a single forward pass given unbalanced point cloud pairs. To validate the efficacy of the proposed method, we create a KITTI-UPP dataset by augmenting the KITTI LiDAR dataset. Experiments on this dataset reveal that the proposed approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art pairwise point cloud registration methods by a large margin, resulting in 78% improvement in Registration Recall when the target point cloud is about 10$\times$ spatially larger and about 10$\times$ times denser than the query point cloud.

 - **Abstract**
 As camera and LiDAR sensors capture complementary information used in autonomous driving, great efforts have been made to develop semantic segmentation algorithms through multi-modality data fusion. However, fusion-based approaches require paired data, i.e., LiDAR point clouds and camera images with strict point-to-pixel mappings, as the inputs in both training and inference, which seriously hinders their application in practical scenarios. Thus, in this work, we propose the 2D Priors Assisted Semantic Segmentation (2DPASS), a general training scheme, to boost the representation learning on point clouds, by fully taking advantage of 2D images with rich appearance. In practice, by leveraging an auxiliary modal fusion and multi-scale fusion-to-single knowledge distillation (MSFSKD), 2DPASS acquires richer semantic and structural information from the multi-modal data, which are then online distilled to the pure 3D network. As a result, equipped with 2DPASS, our baseline shows significant improvement with only point cloud inputs. Specifically, it achieves the state-of-the-arts on two large-scale benchmarks (i.e. SemanticKITTI and NuScenes), including top-1 results in both single and multiple scan(s) competitions of SemanticKITTI.

 - **Abstract**
 LiDAR-based 3D scene perception is a fundamental and important task for autonomous driving. Most state-of-the-art methods on LiDAR-based 3D recognition tasks focus on single frame 3D point cloud data, and the temporal information is ignored in those methods. We argue that the temporal information across the frames provides crucial knowledge for 3D scene perceptions, especially in the driving scenario. In this paper, we focus on spatial and temporal variations to better explore the temporal information across the 3D frames. We design a temporal variation-aware interpolation module and a temporal voxel-point refiner to capture the temporal variation in the 4D point cloud. The temporal variation-aware interpolation generates local features from the previous and current frames by capturing spatial coherence and temporal variation information. The temporal voxel-point refiner builds a temporal graph on the 3D point cloud sequences and captures the temporal variation with a graph convolution module. The temporal voxel-point refiner also transforms the coarse voxel-level predictions into fine point-level predictions. With our proposed modules, the new network TVSN achieves state-of-the-art performance on SemanticKITTI and SemantiPOSS. Specifically, our method achieves 52.5\% in mIoU (+5.5% against previous best approaches) on the multiple scan segmentation task on SemanticKITTI, and 63.0% on SemanticPOSS (+2.8% against previous best approaches).

 - **Abstract**
 LiDAR sensors used in autonomous driving applications are negatively affected by adverse weather conditions. One common, but understudied effect, is the condensation of vehicle gas exhaust in cold weather. This everyday phenomenon can severely impact the quality of LiDAR measurements, resulting in a less accurate environment perception by creating artifacts like ghost object detections. In the literature, the semantic segmentation of adverse weather effects like rain and fog is achieved using learning-based approaches. However, such methods require large sets of labeled data, which can be extremely expensive and laborious to get. We address this problem by presenting a two-step approach for the detection of condensed vehicle gas exhaust. First, we identify for each vehicle in a scene its emission area and detect gas exhaust if present. Then, isolated clouds are detected by modeling through time the regions of space where gas exhaust is likely to be present. We test our method on real urban data, showing that our approach can reliably detect gas exhaust in different scenarios, making it appealing for offline pre-labeling and online applications such as ghost object detection.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.04465
 - **Abstract**
 This paper presents a Progressively-connected Light Field network (ProLiF), for the novel view synthesis of complex forward-facing scenes. ProLiF encodes a 4D light field, which allows rendering a large batch of rays in one training step for image- or patch-level losses. Directly learning a neural light field from images has difficulty in rendering multi-view consistent images due to its unawareness of the underlying 3D geometry. To address this problem, we propose a progressive training scheme and regularization losses to infer the underlying geometry during training, both of which enforce the multi-view consistency and thus greatly improves the rendering quality. Experiments demonstrate that our method is able to achieve significantly better rendering quality than the vanilla neural light fields and comparable results to NeRF-like rendering methods on the challenging LLFF dataset and Shiny Object dataset. Moreover, we demonstrate better compatibility with LPIPS loss to achieve robustness to varying light conditions and CLIP loss to control the rendering style of the scene.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.05009
 - **Abstract**
 We propose an efficient method for rendering complex luminaires using a high-quality octree-based representation of the luminaire emission. Complex luminaires are a particularly challenging problem in rendering, due to their caustic light paths inside the luminaire. We reduce the geometric complexity of luminaires by using a simple proxy geometry and encode the visually-complex emitted light field by using a neural radiance field. We tackle the multiple challenges of using NeRFs for representing luminaires, including their high dynamic range, high-frequency content and null-emission areas, by proposing a specialized loss function. For rendering, we distill our luminaires' NeRF into a Plenoctree, which we can be easily integrated into traditional rendering systems. Our approach allows for speed-ups of up to 2 orders of magnitude in scenes containing complex luminaires introducing minimal error.

### L$_0$onie: Compressing COINs with L$_0$-constraints

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.04144
 - **Abstract**
 Advances in Implicit Neural Representations (INR) have motivated research on domain-agnostic compression techniques. These methods train a neural network to approximate an object, and then store the weights of the trained model. For example, given an image, a network is trained to learn the mapping from pixel locations to RGB values. In this paper, we propose L$_0$onie, a sparsity-constrained extension of the COIN compression method. Sparsity allows to leverage the faster learning of overparameterized networks, while retaining the desirable compression rate of smaller models. Moreover, our constrained formulation ensures that the final model respects a pre-determined compression rate, dispensing of the need for expensive architecture search.

 - **Abstract**
 Unsupervised image transfer enables intra- and inter-modality transfer for medical applications where a large amount of paired training data is not abundant. To ensure a structure-preserving mapping from the input to the target domain, existing methods for unpaired medical image transfer are commonly based on cycle-consistency, causing additional computation resources and instability due to the learning of an inverse mapping. This paper presents a novel method for uni-directional domain mapping where no paired data is needed throughout the entire training process. A reasonable transfer is ensured by employing the GAN architecture and a novel generator loss based on patch invariance. To be more precise, generator outputs are evaluated and compared on different scales, which brings increased attention to high-frequency details as well as implicit data augmentation. This novel term also gives the opportunity to predict aleatoric uncertainty by modeling an input-dependent scale map for the patch residuals. The proposed method is comprehensively evaluated on three renowned medical databases. Superior accuracy on these datasets compared to four different state-of-the-art methods for unpaired image transfer suggests the great potential of this approach for uncertainty-aware medical image translation. Implementation of the proposed framework is released here: https://github.com/anger-man/unsupervised-image-transfer-and-uq.

 - **Abstract**
 Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are brain-inspired machine learning algorithms with merits such as biological plausibility and unsupervised learning capability. Previous works have shown that converting Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) into SNNs is a practical and efficient approach for implementing an SNN. However, the basic principle and theoretical groundwork are lacking for training a non-accuracy-loss SNN. This paper establishes a precise mathematical mapping between the biological parameters of the Linear Leaky-Integrate-and-Fire model (LIF)/SNNs and the parameters of ReLU-AN/Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). Such mapping relationship is analytically proven under certain conditions and demonstrated by simulation and real data experiments. It can serve as the theoretical basis for the potential combination of the respective merits of the two categories of neural networks.

 - **Abstract**
 This article presents the CERBERUS robotic system-of-systems, which won the DARPA Subterranean Challenge Final Event in 2021. The Subterranean Challenge was organized by DARPA with the vision to facilitate the novel technologies necessary to reliably explore diverse underground environments despite the grueling challenges they present for robotic autonomy. Due to their geometric complexity, degraded perceptual conditions combined with lack of GPS support, austere navigation conditions, and denied communications, subterranean settings render autonomous operations particularly demanding. In response to this challenge, we developed the CERBERUS system which exploits the synergy of legged and flying robots, coupled with robust control especially for overcoming perilous terrain, multi-modal and multi-robot perception for localization and mapping in conditions of sensor degradation, and resilient autonomy through unified exploration path planning and local motion planning that reflects robot-specific limitations. Based on its ability to explore diverse underground environments and its high-level command and control by a single human supervisor, CERBERUS demonstrated efficient exploration, reliable detection of objects of interest, and accurate mapping. In this article, we report results from both the preliminary runs and the final Prize Round of the DARPA Subterranean Challenge, and discuss highlights and challenges faced, alongside lessons learned for the benefit of the community.

 - **Abstract**
 We propose to explore a new problem called audio-visual segmentation (AVS), in which the goal is to output a pixel-level map of the object(s) that produce sound at the time of the image frame. To facilitate this research, we construct the first audio-visual segmentation benchmark (AVSBench), providing pixel-wise annotations for the sounding objects in audible videos. Two settings are studied with this benchmark: 1) semi-supervised audio-visual segmentation with a single sound source and 2) fully-supervised audio-visual segmentation with multiple sound sources. To deal with the AVS problem, we propose a novel method that uses a temporal pixel-wise audio-visual interaction module to inject audio semantics as guidance for the visual segmentation process. We also design a regularization loss to encourage the audio-visual mapping during training. Quantitative and qualitative experiments on the AVSBench compare our approach to several existing methods from related tasks, demonstrating that the proposed method is promising for building a bridge between the audio and pixel-wise visual semantics. Code is available at https://github.com/OpenNLPLab/AVSBench.

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.04201
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.04201
 - **Abstract**
 In this technical report, we represent our solution for the Human-centric Spatio-Temporal Video Grounding (HC-STVG) track of the 4th Person in Context (PIC) workshop and challenge. Our solution is built on the basis of TubeDETR and Mutual Matching Network (MMN). Specifically, TubeDETR exploits a video-text encoder and a space-time decoder to predict the starting time, the ending time and the tube of the target person. MMN detects persons in images, links them as tubes, extracts features of person tubes and the text description, and predicts the similarities between them to choose the most likely person tube as the grounding result. Our solution finally finetunes the results by combining the spatio localization of MMN and with temporal localization of TubeDETR. In the HC-STVG track of the 4th PIC challenge, our solution achieves the third place.
### Radiomics-Guided Global-Local Transformer for Weakly Supervised  Pathology Localization in Chest X-Rays

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.04394
 - **Abstract**
 Before the recent success of deep learning methods for automated medical image analysis, practitioners used handcrafted radiomic features to quantitatively describe local patches of medical images. However, extracting discriminative radiomic features relies on accurate pathology localization, which is difficult to acquire in real-world settings. Despite advances in disease classification and localization from chest X-rays, many approaches fail to incorporate clinically-informed domain knowledge. For these reasons, we propose a Radiomics-Guided Transformer (RGT) that fuses \textit{global} image information with \textit{local} knowledge-guided radiomics information to provide accurate cardiopulmonary pathology localization and classification \textit{without any bounding box annotations}. RGT consists of an image Transformer branch, a radiomics Transformer branch, and fusion layers that aggregate image and radiomic information. Using the learned self-attention of its image branch, RGT extracts a bounding box for which to compute radiomic features, which are further processed by the radiomics branch; learned image and radiomic features are then fused and mutually interact via cross-attention layers. Thus, RGT utilizes a novel end-to-end feedback loop that can bootstrap accurate pathology localization only using image-level disease labels. Experiments on the NIH ChestXRay dataset demonstrate that RGT outperforms prior works in weakly supervised disease localization (by an average margin of 3.6\% over various intersection-over-union thresholds) and classification (by 1.1\% in average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve). Code and trained models will be released upon acceptance.
### Mix-Teaching: A Simple, Unified and Effective Semi-Supervised Learning  Framework for Monocular 3D Object Detection

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.04448
 - **Abstract**
 Monocular 3D object detection is an essential perception task for autonomous driving. However, the high reliance on large-scale labeled data make it costly and time-consuming during model optimization. To reduce such over-reliance on human annotations, we propose Mix-Teaching, an effective semi-supervised learning framework applicable to employ both labeled and unlabeled images in training stage. Mix-Teaching first generates pseudo-labels for unlabeled images by self-training. The student model is then trained on the mixed images possessing much more intensive and precise labeling by merging instance-level image patches into empty backgrounds or labeled images. This is the first to break the image-level limitation and put high-quality pseudo labels from multi frames into one image for semi-supervised training. Besides, as a result of the misalignment between confidence score and localization quality, it's hard to discriminate high-quality pseudo-labels from noisy predictions using only confidence-based criterion. To that end, we further introduce an uncertainty-based filter to help select reliable pseudo boxes for the above mixing operation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first unified SSL framework for monocular 3D object detection. Mix-Teaching consistently improves MonoFlex and GUPNet by significant margins under various labeling ratios on KITTI dataset. For example, our method achieves around +6.34% AP@0.7 improvement against the GUPNet baseline on validation set when using only 10% labeled data. Besides, by leveraging full training set and the additional 48K raw images of KITTI, it can further improve the MonoFlex by +4.65% improvement on AP@0.7 for car detection, reaching 18.54% AP@0.7, which ranks the 1st place among all monocular based methods on KITTI test leaderboard. The code and pretrained models will be released at https://github.com/yanglei18/Mix-Teaching.

 - **Abstract**
 The focus on privacy-related measures regarding wireless networks grew in last couple of years. This is especially important with technologies like Wi-Fi or Bluetooth, which are all around us and our smartphones use them not just for connection to the internet or other devices, but for localization purposes as well. In this paper, we analyze and evaluate probe request frames of 802.11 wireless protocol captured during the 11th international conference on Indoor Positioning and Indoor Navigation (IPIN) 2021. We explore the temporal occupancy of the conference space during four days of the conference as well as non-cooperatively track the presence of devices in the proximity of the session rooms using 802.11 management frames, with and without using MAC address randomization. We carried out this analysis without trying to identify/reveal the identity of the users or in any way reverse the MAC address randomization. As a result of the analysis, we detected that there are still many devices not adopting MAC randomization, because either it is not implemented, or users disabled it. In addition, many devices can be easily tracked despite employing MAC randomization.

 - **Abstract**
 Deep learning has substantially boosted the performance of Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE), a critical component in fully vision-based autonomous driving (AD) systems (e.g., Tesla and Toyota). In this work, we develop an attack against learning-based MDE. In particular, we use an optimization-based method to systematically generate stealthy physical-object-oriented adversarial patches to attack depth estimation. We balance the stealth and effectiveness of our attack with object-oriented adversarial design, sensitive region localization, and natural style camouflage. Using real-world driving scenarios, we evaluate our attack on concurrent MDE models and a representative downstream task for AD (i.e., 3D object detection). Experimental results show that our method can generate stealthy, effective, and robust adversarial patches for different target objects and models and achieves more than 6 meters mean depth estimation error and 93% attack success rate (ASR) in object detection with a patch of 1/9 of the vehicle's rear area. Field tests on three different driving routes with a real vehicle indicate that we cause over 6 meters mean depth estimation error and reduce the object detection rate from 90.70% to 5.16% in continuous video frames.

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.04764
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.04764
 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we consider space-time goal-oriented a posteriori error estimation for parabolic problems. Temporal and spatial discretizations are based on Galerkin finite elements of continuous and discontinuous type. The main objectives are the development and analysis of space-time estimators, in which the localization is based on a weak form employing a partition-of-unity. The resulting error indicators are used for temporal and spatial adaptivity. Our developments are substantiated with several numerical examples.

 - **Abstract**
 With recent advancements, the wireless local area network (WLAN) or wireless fidelity (Wi-Fi) technology has been successfully utilized to realize sensing functionalities such as detection, localization, and recognition. However, the WLANs standards are developed mainly for the purpose of communication, and thus may not be able to meet the stringent sensing requirements in emerging applications. To resolve this issue, a new Task Group (TG), namely IEEE 802.11bf, has been established by the IEEE 802.11 working group, with the objective of creating a new amendment to the WLAN standard to provide advanced sensing requirements while minimizing the effect on communications. This paper provides a comprehensive overview on the up-to-date efforts in the IEEE 802.11bf TG. First, we introduce the definition of the 802.11bf amendment and its standardization timeline. Then, we discuss the WLAN sensing procedure and framework used for measurement acquisition, by considering both conventional sensing at sub-7 GHz and directional multi-gigabit (DMG) sensing at 60 GHz, respectively. Next, we present various candidate technical features for IEEE 802.11bf, including waveform/sequence design, feedback types, quantization, as well as security and privacy. Finally, we describe the methodologies used by the IEEE 802.11bf TG to evaluate the alternative performance. It is desired that this overview paper provide useful insights on IEEE 802.11 WLAN sensing to people with great interests and promote the IEEE 802.11bf standard to be widely deployed.

 This article presents the CERBERUS robotic system-of-systems, which won the DARPA Subterranean Challenge Final Event in 2021. The Subterranean Challenge was organized by DARPA with the vision to facilitate the novel technologies necessary to reliably explore diverse underground environments despite the grueling challenges they present for robotic autonomy. Due to their geometric complexity, degraded perceptual conditions combined with lack of GPS support, austere navigation conditions, and denied communications, subterranean settings render autonomous operations particularly demanding. In response to this challenge, we developed the CERBERUS system which exploits the synergy of legged and flying robots, coupled with robust control especially for overcoming perilous terrain, multi-modal and multi-robot perception for localization and mapping in conditions of sensor degradation, and resilient autonomy through unified exploration path planning and local motion planning that reflects robot-specific limitations. Based on its ability to explore diverse underground environments and its high-level command and control by a single human supervisor, CERBERUS demonstrated efficient exploration, reliable detection of objects of interest, and accurate mapping. In this article, we report results from both the preliminary runs and the final Prize Round of the DARPA Subterranean Challenge, and discuss highlights and challenges faced, alongside lessons learned for the benefit of the community.

 - **Abstract**
 Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) algorithms are frequently deployed to support a wide range of robotics applications, such as autonomous navigation in unknown environments, and scene mapping in virtual reality. Many of these applications require the autonomous agents performing SLAM with highly dynamic objects in the scene. To this end, this tutorial extends a recently introduced, unifying optimization-based SLAM backend framework to environments with moving objects and features. Using this framework, we consider a rapprochement of recent advances in dynamic SLAM. Moreover, we present a novel, filtering-based dynamic SLAM algorithm, named dynamic EKF SLAM within our framework, and prove that it is mathematically equivalent to a direct extension of the classical EKF SLAM algorithm to the dynamic environment setting. Empirical results with simulated data indicate that dynamic EKF SLAM can achieve high localization and mobile object pose estimation accuracy, as well as high map precision.

 - **Abstract**
 We propose TAIN (Transformers and Attention for video INterpolation), a residual neural network for video interpolation, which aims to interpolate an intermediate frame given two consecutive image frames around it. We first present a novel visual transformer module, named Cross-Similarity (CS), to globally aggregate input image features with similar appearance as those of the predicted interpolated frame. These CS features are then used to refine the interpolated prediction. To account for occlusions in the CS features, we propose an Image Attention (IA) module to allow the network to focus on CS features from one frame over those of the other. Additionally, we augment our training dataset with an occluder patch that moves across frames to improve the network's robustness to occlusions and large motion. Because existing methods yield smooth predictions especially near MBs, we use an additional training loss based on image gradient to yield sharper predictions. TAIN outperforms existing methods that do not require flow estimation and performs comparably to flow-based methods while being computationally efficient in terms of inference time on Vimeo90k, UCF101, and SNU-FILM benchmarks.

 - **Abstract**
 Neural Processes (NPs) are a popular class of approaches for meta-learning. Similar to Gaussian Processes (GPs), NPs define distributions over functions and can estimate uncertainty in their predictions. However, unlike GPs, NPs and their variants suffer from underfitting and often have intractable likelihoods, which limit their applications in sequential decision making. We propose Transformer Neural Processes (TNPs), a new member of the NP family that casts uncertainty-aware meta learning as a sequence modeling problem. We learn TNPs via an autoregressive likelihood-based objective and instantiate it with a novel transformer-based architecture. The model architecture respects the inductive biases inherent to the problem structure, such as invariance to the observed data points and equivariance to the unobserved points. We further investigate knobs within the TNP framework that tradeoff expressivity of the decoding distribution with extra computation. Empirically, we show that TNPs achieve state-of-the-art performance on various benchmark problems, outperforming all previous NP variants on meta regression, image completion, contextual multi-armed bandits, and Bayesian optimization.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we study different approaches to self-supervised pretraining of object detection models. We first design a general framework to learn a spatially consistent dense representation from an image, by randomly sampling and projecting boxes to each augmented view and maximizing the similarity between corresponding box features. We study existing design choices in the literature, such as box generation, feature extraction strategies, and using multiple views inspired by its success on instance-level image representation learning techniques. Our results suggest that the method is robust to different choices of hyperparameters, and using multiple views is not as effective as shown for instance-level image representation learning. We also design two auxiliary tasks to predict boxes in one view from their features in the other view, by (1) predicting boxes from the sampled set by using a contrastive loss, and (2) predicting box coordinates using a transformer, which potentially benefits downstream object detection tasks. We found that these tasks do not lead to better object detection performance when finetuning the pretrained model on labeled data.

 - **Abstract**
 The Synthetic Control method has pioneered a class of powerful data-driven techniques to estimate the counterfactual reality of a unit from donor units. At its core, the technique involves a linear model fitted on the pre-intervention period that combines donor outcomes to yield the counterfactual. However, linearly combining spatial information at each time instance using time-agnostic weights fails to capture important inter-unit and intra-unit temporal contexts and complex nonlinear dynamics of real data. We instead propose an approach to use local spatiotemporal information before the onset of the intervention as a promising way to estimate the counterfactual sequence. To this end, we suggest a Transformer model that leverages particular positional embeddings, a modified decoder attention mask, and a novel pre-training task to perform spatiotemporal sequence-to-sequence modeling. Our experiments on synthetic data demonstrate the efficacy of our method in the typical small donor pool setting and its robustness against noise. We also generate actionable healthcare insights at the population and patient levels by simulating a state-wide public health policy to evaluate its effectiveness, an in silico trial for asthma medications to support randomized controlled trials, and a medical intervention for patients with Friedreich's ataxia to improve clinical decision-making and promote personalized therapy.
### SiaTrans: Siamese Transformer Network for RGB-D Salient Object Detection  with Depth Image Classification

 - **Abstract**
 RGB-D SOD uses depth information to handle challenging scenes and obtain high-quality saliency maps. Existing state-of-the-art RGB-D saliency detection methods overwhelmingly rely on the strategy of directly fusing depth information. Although these methods improve the accuracy of saliency prediction through various cross-modality fusion strategies, misinformation provided by some poor-quality depth images can affect the saliency prediction result. To address this issue, a novel RGB-D salient object detection model (SiaTrans) is proposed in this paper, which allows training on depth image quality classification at the same time as training on SOD. In light of the common information between RGB and depth images on salient objects, SiaTrans uses a Siamese transformer network with shared weight parameters as the encoder and extracts RGB and depth features concatenated on the batch dimension, saving space resources without compromising performance. SiaTrans uses the Class token in the backbone network (T2T-ViT) to classify the quality of depth images without preventing the token sequence from going on with the saliency detection task. Transformer-based cross-modality fusion module (CMF) can effectively fuse RGB and depth information. And in the testing process, CMF can choose to fuse cross-modality information or enhance RGB information according to the quality classification signal of the depth image. The greatest benefit of our designed CMF and decoder is that they maintain the consistency of RGB and RGB-D information decoding: SiaTrans decodes RGB-D or RGB information under the same model parameters according to the classification signal during testing. Comprehensive experiments on nine RGB-D SOD benchmark datasets show that SiaTrans has the best overall performance and the least computation compared with recent state-of-the-art methods.

 - **Abstract**
 Very large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-3 and Codex have achieved state-of-the-art performance on several natural-language tasks, and show great promise also for code. A particularly exciting aspect of LLMs is their knack for few-shot and zero-shot learning: they can learn to perform a task with very few examples. Few-shotting has particular synergies in software engineering, where there are a lot of phenomena (identifier names, APIs, terminology, coding patterns) that are known to be highly project-specific. However, project-specific data can be quite limited, especially early in the history of a project; thus the few-shot learning capacity of LLMs might be very relevant. In this paper, we investigate the use few-shot training with the very large GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) Codex model, and find evidence suggesting that one can significantly surpass state-of-the-art models for code-summarization, leveraging project-specific training.

 - **Abstract**
 Transformer-based models have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in many intelligent coding tasks such as code comment generation and code completion. Previous studies show that deep learning models are sensitive to the input variations, but few studies have systematically studied the robustness of Transformer under perturbed input code. In this work, we empirically study the effect of semantic-preserving code transformation on the performance of Transformer. Specifically, 24 and 27 code transformation strategies are implemented for two popular programming languages, Java and Python, respectively. For facilitating analysis, the strategies are grouped into five categories: block transformation, insertion/deletion transformation, grammatical statement transformation, grammatical token transformation, and identifier transformation. Experiments on three popular code intelligence tasks, including code completion, code summarization and code search, demonstrate insertion/deletion transformation and identifier transformation show the greatest impact on the performance of Transformer. Our results also suggest that Transformer based on abstract syntax trees (ASTs) shows more robust performance than the model based on only code sequence under most code transformations. Besides, the design of positional encoding can impact the robustness of Transformer under code transformation. Based on our findings, we distill some insights about the challenges and opportunities for Transformer-based code intelligence.

 - **Abstract**
 Multi-person pose understanding from RGB videos includes three complex tasks: pose estimation, tracking and motion forecasting. Among these three tasks, pose estimation and tracking are correlated, and tracking is crucial to motion forecasting. Most existing works either focus on a single task or employ cascaded methods to solve each individual task separately. In this paper, we propose Snipper, a framework to perform multi-person 3D pose estimation, tracking and motion forecasting simultaneously in a single inference. Specifically, we first propose a deformable attention mechanism to aggregate spatiotemporal information from video snippets. Building upon this deformable attention, a visual transformer is learned to encode the spatiotemporal features from multi-frame images and to decode informative pose features to update multi-person pose queries. Last, these queries are regressed to predict multi-person pose trajectories and future motions in one forward pass. In the experiments, we show the effectiveness of Snipper on three challenging public datasets where a generic model rivals specialized state-of-art baselines for pose estimation, tracking, and forecasting.

### Radiomics-Guided Global-Local Transformer for Weakly Supervised  Pathology Localization in Chest X-Rays

 - **Abstract**
 Before the recent success of deep learning methods for automated medical image analysis, practitioners used handcrafted radiomic features to quantitatively describe local patches of medical images. However, extracting discriminative radiomic features relies on accurate pathology localization, which is difficult to acquire in real-world settings. Despite advances in disease classification and localization from chest X-rays, many approaches fail to incorporate clinically-informed domain knowledge. For these reasons, we propose a Radiomics-Guided Transformer (RGT) that fuses \textit{global} image information with \textit{local} knowledge-guided radiomics information to provide accurate cardiopulmonary pathology localization and classification \textit{without any bounding box annotations}. RGT consists of an image Transformer branch, a radiomics Transformer branch, and fusion layers that aggregate image and radiomic information. Using the learned self-attention of its image branch, RGT extracts a bounding box for which to compute radiomic features, which are further processed by the radiomics branch; learned image and radiomic features are then fused and mutually interact via cross-attention layers. Thus, RGT utilizes a novel end-to-end feedback loop that can bootstrap accurate pathology localization only using image-level disease labels. Experiments on the NIH ChestXRay dataset demonstrate that RGT outperforms prior works in weakly supervised disease localization (by an average margin of 3.6\% over various intersection-over-union thresholds) and classification (by 1.1\% in average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve). Code and trained models will be released upon acceptance.

 - **Abstract**
 A surge of interest in Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) has produced thousands of GCN variants, with hundreds introduced every year. In contrast, many GCN models re-use only a handful of benchmark datasets as many graphs of interest, such as social or commercial networks, are proprietary. We propose a new graph generation problem to enable generating a diverse set of benchmark graphs for GCNs following the distribution of a source graph -- possibly proprietary -- with three requirements: 1) benchmark effectiveness as a substitute for the source graph for GCN research, 2) scalability to process large-scale real-world graphs, and 3) a privacy guarantee for end-users. With a novel graph encoding scheme, we reframe large-scale graph generation problem into medium-length sequence generation problem and apply the strong generation power of the Transformer architecture to the graph domain. Extensive experiments across a vast body of graph generative models show that our model can successfully generate benchmark graphs with the realistic graph structure, node attributes, and node labels required to benchmark GCNs on node classification tasks.

 - **Abstract**
 Transformers are built upon multi-head scaled dot-product attention and positional encoding, which aim to learn the feature representations and token dependencies. In this work, we focus on enhancing the distinctive representation by learning to augment the feature maps with the self-attention mechanism in Transformers. Specifically, we propose the horizontal attention to re-weight the multi-head output of the scaled dot-product attention before dimensionality reduction, and propose the vertical attention to adaptively re-calibrate channel-wise feature responses by explicitly modelling inter-dependencies among different channels. We demonstrate the Transformer models equipped with the two attentions have a high generalization capability across different supervised learning tasks, with a very minor additional computational cost overhead. The proposed horizontal and vertical attentions are highly modular, which can be inserted into various Transformer models to further improve the performance. Our code is available in the supplementary material.

 - **Abstract**
 Scene segmentation in images is a fundamental yet challenging problem in visual content understanding, which is to learn a model to assign every image pixel to a categorical label. One of the challenges for this learning task is to consider the spatial and semantic relationships to obtain descriptive feature representations, so learning the feature maps from multiple scales is a common practice in scene segmentation. In this paper, we explore the effective use of self-attention within multi-scale image windows to learn descriptive visual features, then propose three different strategies to aggregate these feature maps to decode the feature representation for dense prediction. Our design is based on the recently proposed Swin Transformer models, which totally discards convolution operations. With the simple yet effective multi-scale feature learning and aggregation, our models achieve very promising performance on four public scene segmentation datasets, PASCAL VOC2012, COCO-Stuff 10K, ADE20K and Cityscapes.

 - **Abstract**
 The Transformer-based encoder-decoder architecture has recently made significant advances in recognizing handwritten mathematical expressions. However, the transformer model still suffers from the lack of coverage problem, making its expression recognition rate (ExpRate) inferior to its RNN counterpart. Coverage information, which records the alignment information of the past steps, has proven effective in the RNN models. In this paper, we propose CoMER, a model that adopts the coverage information in the transformer decoder. Specifically, we propose a novel Attention Refinement Module (ARM) to refine the attention weights with past alignment information without hurting its parallelism. Furthermore, we take coverage information to the extreme by proposing self-coverage and cross-coverage, which utilize the past alignment information from the current and previous layers. Experiments show that CoMER improves the ExpRate by 0.61%/2.09%/1.59% compared to the current state-of-the-art model, and reaches 59.33%/59.81%/62.97% on the CROHME 2014/2016/2019 test sets.

 - **Abstract**
 Extreme Classification (XC) seeks to tag data points with the most relevant subset of labels from an extremely large label set. Performing deep XC with dense, learnt representations for data points and labels has attracted much attention due to its superiority over earlier XC methods that used sparse, hand-crafted features. Negative mining techniques have emerged as a critical component of all deep XC methods that allow them to scale to millions of labels. However, despite recent advances, training deep XC models with large encoder architectures such as transformers remains challenging. This paper identifies that memory overheads of popular negative mining techniques often force mini-batch sizes to remain small and slow training down. In response, this paper introduces NGAME, a light-weight mini-batch creation technique that offers provably accurate in-batch negative samples. This allows training with larger mini-batches offering significantly faster convergence and higher accuracies than existing negative sampling techniques. NGAME was found to be up to 16% more accurate than state-of-the-art methods on a wide array of benchmark datasets for extreme classification, as well as 3% more accurate at retrieving search engine queries in response to a user webpage visit to show personalized ads. In live A/B tests on a popular search engine, NGAME yielded up to 23% gains in click-through-rates.

 - **Abstract**
 Predicting clinical outcomes to anti-cancer drugs on a personalized basis is challenging in cancer treatment due to the heterogeneity of tumors. Traditional computational efforts have been made to model the effect of drug response on individual samples depicted by their molecular profile, yet overfitting occurs because of the high dimension for omics data, hindering models from clinical application. Recent research shows that deep learning is a promising approach to build drug response models by learning alignment patterns between drugs and samples. However, existing studies employed the simple feature fusion strategy and only considered the drug features as a whole representation while ignoring the substructure information that may play a vital role when aligning drugs and genes. Hereby in this paper, we propose TCR (Transformer based network for Cancer drug Response) to predict anti-cancer drug response. By utilizing an attention mechanism, TCR is able to learn the interactions between drug atom/sub-structure and molecular signatures efficiently in our study. Furthermore, a dual loss function and cross sampling strategy were designed to improve the prediction power of TCR. We show that TCR outperformed all other methods under various data splitting strategies on all evaluation matrices (some with significant improvement). Extensive experiments demonstrate that TCR shows significantly improved generalization ability on independent in-vitro experiments and in-vivo real patient data. Our study highlights the prediction power of TCR and its potential value for cancer drug repurpose and precision oncology treatment.

 In Natural Language Processing, the use of pre-trained language models has been shown to obtain state-of-the-art results in many downstream tasks such as sentiment analysis, author identification and others. In this work, we address the use of these methods for personality classification from text. Focusing on the Myers-Briggs (MBTI) personality model, we describe a series of experiments in which the well-known Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model is fine-tuned to perform MBTI classification. Our main findings suggest that the current approach significantly outperforms well-known text classification models based on bag-of-words and static word embeddings alike across multiple evaluation scenarios, and generally outperforms previous work in the field.

 - **Abstract**
 Recently, Transformer-based methods, which predict polygon points or Bezier curve control points to localize texts, are quite popular in scene text detection. However, the used point label form implies the reading order of humans, which affects the robustness of Transformer model. As for the model architecture, the formulation of queries used in decoder has not been fully explored by previous methods. In this paper, we propose a concise dynamic point scene text detection Transformer network termed DPText-DETR, which directly uses point coordinates as queries and dynamically updates them between decoder layers. We point out a simple yet effective positional point label form to tackle the side effect of the original one. Moreover, an Enhanced Factorized Self-Attention module is designed to explicitly model the circular shape of polygon point sequences beyond non-local attention. Extensive experiments prove the training efficiency, robustness, and state-of-the-art performance on various arbitrary shape scene text benchmarks. Beyond detector, we observe that existing end-to-end spotters struggle to recognize inverse-like texts. To evaluate their performance objectively and facilitate future research, we propose an Inverse-Text test set containing 500 manually labeled images. The code and Inverse-Text test set will be available at https://github.com/ymy-k/DPText-DETR.

 - **Abstract**
 Automated image classification is a common task for supervised machine learning in food science. An example is the image-based classification of the fruit's external quality or ripeness. For this purpose, deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are typically used. These models usually require a large number of labeled training samples and enhanced computational resources. While commercial fruit sorting lines readily meet these requirements, the use of machine learning approaches can be hindered by these prerequisites, especially for smallholder farmers in the developing world. We propose an alternative method based on pre-trained vision transformers (ViTs) that is particularly suitable for domains with low availability of data and limited computational resources. It can be easily implemented with limited resources on a standard device, which can democratize the use of these models for smartphone-based image classification in developing countries. We demonstrate the competitiveness of our method by benchmarking two different classification tasks on domain data sets of banana and apple fruits with well-established CNN approaches. Our method achieves a classification accuracy of less than one percent below the best-performing CNN (0.950 vs. 0.958) on a training data set of 3745 images. At the same time, our method is superior when only a small number of labeled training samples is available. It requires three times less data to achieve a 0.90 accuracy compared to CNNs. In addition, visualizations of low-dimensional feature embeddings show that the model used in our study extracts excellent features from unseen data without allocating labels.

 - **Abstract**
 Attention-based models such as transformers have shown outstanding performance on dense prediction tasks, such as semantic segmentation, owing to their capability of capturing long-range dependency in an image. However, the benefit of transformers for monocular depth prediction has seldom been explored so far. This paper benchmarks various transformer-based models for the depth estimation task on an indoor NYUV2 dataset and an outdoor KITTI dataset. We propose a novel attention-based architecture, Depthformer for monocular depth estimation that uses multi-head self-attention to produce the multiscale feature maps, which are effectively combined by our proposed decoder network. We also propose a Transbins module that divides the depth range into bins whose center value is estimated adaptively per image. The final depth estimated is a linear combination of bin centers for each pixel. Transbins module takes advantage of the global receptive field using the transformer module in the encoding stage. Experimental results on NYUV2 and KITTI depth estimation benchmark demonstrate that our proposed method improves the state-of-the-art by 3.3%, and 3.3% respectively in terms of Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

 - **Abstract**
 Corporate credit ratings issued by third-party rating agencies are quantified assessments of a company's creditworthiness. Credit Ratings highly correlate to the likelihood of a company defaulting on its debt obligations. These ratings play critical roles in investment decision-making as one of the key risk factors. They are also central to the regulatory framework such as BASEL II in calculating necessary capital for financial institutions. Being able to predict rating changes will greatly benefit both investors and regulators alike. In this paper, we consider the corporate credit rating migration early prediction problem, which predicts the credit rating of an issuer will be upgraded, unchanged, or downgraded after 12 months based on its latest financial reporting information at the time. We investigate the effectiveness of different standard machine learning algorithms and conclude these models deliver inferior performance. As part of our contribution, we propose a new Multi-task Envisioning Transformer-based Autoencoder (META) model to tackle this challenging problem. META consists of Positional Encoding, Transformer-based Autoencoder, and Multi-task Prediction to learn effective representations for both migration prediction and rating prediction. This enables META to better explore the historical data in the training stage for one-year later prediction. Experimental results show that META outperforms all baseline models.

 Sparse tensors are rapidly becoming critical components of modern deep learning workloads. However, developing high-performance sparse operators can be difficult and tedious, and existing vendor libraries cannot satisfy the escalating demands from new operators. Sparse tensor compilers simplify the development of operators, but efficient sparse compilation for deep learning remains challenging because a single sparse format cannot maximize hardware efficiency, and single-shot compilers cannot keep up with latest hardware and system advances. We show that the key to addressing both challenges is two forms of composability. In this paper, we propose SparseTIR, a sparse tensor compilation abstraction that offers composable formats and composable transformations for deep learning workloads. SparseTIR constructs a search space over these composable components for performance tuning. With these improvements, SparseTIR obtains consistent performance speedups vs vendor libraries on GPUs for single operators: 1.1-3.3x for GNN operators and 1.1-4.4x for sparse transformer operators. SparseTIR also accelerates end-to-end GNNs by 1.1-2.2x for GraphSAGE training and 0.9-26x for RGCN inference.

 - **Abstract**
 Translating machine learning algorithms into clinical applications requires addressing challenges related to interpretability, such as accounting for the effect of confounding variables (or metadata). Confounding variables affect the relationship between input training data and target outputs. When we train a model on such data, confounding variables will bias the distribution of the learned features. A recent promising solution, MetaData Normalization (MDN), estimates the linear relationship between the metadata and each feature based on a non-trainable closed-form solution. However, this estimation is confined by the sample size of a mini-batch and thereby may cause the approach to be unstable during training. In this paper, we extend the MDN method by applying a Penalty approach (referred to as PDMN). We cast the problem into a bi-level nested optimization problem. We then approximate this optimization problem using a penalty method so that the linear parameters within the MDN layer are trainable and learned on all samples. This enables PMDN to be plugged into any architectures, even those unfit to run batch-level operations, such as transformers and recurrent models. We show improvement in model accuracy and greater independence from confounders using PMDN over MDN in a synthetic experiment and a multi-label, multi-site dataset of magnetic resonance images (MRIs).

 We present SkexGen, a novel autoregressive generative model for computer-aided design (CAD) construction sequences containing sketch-and-extrude modeling operations. Our model utilizes distinct Transformer architectures to encode topological, geometric, and extrusion variations of construction sequences into disentangled codebooks. Autoregressive Transformer decoders generate CAD construction sequences sharing certain properties specified by the codebook vectors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our disentangled codebook representation generates diverse and high-quality CAD models, enhances user control, and enables efficient exploration of the design space.

 - **Abstract**
 Learning user sequence behaviour embedding is very sophisticated and challenging due to the complicated feature interactions over time and high dimensions of user features. Recent emerging foundation models, e.g., BERT and its variants, encourage a large body of researchers to investigate in this field. However, unlike natural language processing (NLP) tasks, the parameters of user behaviour model come mostly from user embedding layer, which makes most existing works fail in training a universal user embedding of large scale. Furthermore, user representations are learned from multiple downstream tasks, and the past research work do not address the seesaw phenomenon. In this paper, we propose SUPERMOE, a generic framework to obtain high quality user representation from multiple tasks. Specifically, the user behaviour sequences are encoded by MoE transformer, and we can thus increase the model capacity to billions of parameters, or even to trillions of parameters. In order to deal with seesaw phenomenon when learning across multiple tasks, we design a new loss function with task indicators. We perform extensive offline experiments on public datasets and online experiments on private real-world business scenarios. Our approach achieves the best performance over state-of-the-art models, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.

 - **Abstract**
 Currently deployed public-key cryptosystems will be vulnerable to attacks by full-scale quantum computers. Consequently, "quantum resistant" cryptosystems are in high demand, and lattice-based cryptosystems, based on a hard problem known as Learning With Errors (LWE), have emerged as strong contenders for standardization. In this work, we train transformers to perform modular arithmetic and combine half-trained models with statistical cryptanalysis techniques to propose SALSA: a machine learning attack on LWE-based cryptographic schemes. SALSA can fully recover secrets for small-to-mid size LWE instances with sparse binary secrets, and may scale to attack real-world LWE-based cryptosystems.

 - **Abstract**
 Video-text retrieval is a class of cross-modal representation learning problems, where the goal is to select the video which corresponds to the text query between a given text query and a pool of candidate videos. The contrastive paradigm of vision-language pretraining has shown promising success with large-scale datasets and unified transformer architecture, and demonstrated the power of a joint latent space. Despite this, the intrinsic divergence between the visual domain and textual domain is still far from being eliminated, and projecting different modalities into a joint latent space might result in the distorting of the information inside the single modality. To overcome the above issue, we present a novel mechanism for learning the translation relationship from a source modality space $\mathcal{S}$ to a target modality space $\mathcal{T}$ without the need for a joint latent space, which bridges the gap between visual and textual domains. Furthermore, to keep cycle consistency between translations, we adopt a cycle loss involving both forward translations from $\mathcal{S}$ to the predicted target space $\mathcal{T'}$, and backward translations from $\mathcal{T'}$ back to $\mathcal{S}$. Extensive experiments conducted on MSR-VTT, MSVD, and DiDeMo datasets demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of our LaT approach compared with vanilla state-of-the-art methods.

 The ability to extrapolate from short problem instances to longer ones is an important form of out-of-distribution generalization in reasoning tasks, and is crucial when learning from datasets where longer problem instances are rare. These include theorem proving, solving quantitative mathematics problems, and reading/summarizing novels. In this paper, we run careful empirical studies exploring the length generalization capabilities of transformer-based language models. We first establish that naively finetuning transformers on length generalization tasks shows significant generalization deficiencies independent of model scale. We then show that combining pretrained large language models' in-context learning abilities with scratchpad prompting (asking the model to output solution steps before producing an answer) results in a dramatic improvement in length generalization. We run careful failure analyses on each of the learning modalities and identify common sources of mistakes that highlight opportunities in equipping language models with the ability to generalize to longer problems.

 - **Abstract**
 Prior works have proposed several strategies to reduce the computational cost of self-attention mechanism. Many of these works consider decomposing the self-attention procedure into regional and local feature extraction procedures that each incurs a much smaller computational complexity. However, regional information is typically only achieved at the expense of undesirable information lost owing to down-sampling. In this paper, we propose a novel Transformer architecture that aims to mitigate the cost issue, named Dual Vision Transformer (Dual-ViT). The new architecture incorporates a critical semantic pathway that can more efficiently compress token vectors into global semantics with reduced order of complexity. Such compressed global semantics then serve as useful prior information in learning finer pixel level details, through another constructed pixel pathway. The semantic pathway and pixel pathway are then integrated together and are jointly trained, spreading the enhanced self-attention information in parallel through both of the pathways. Dual-ViT is henceforth able to reduce the computational complexity without compromising much accuracy. We empirically demonstrate that Dual-ViT provides superior accuracy than SOTA Transformer architectures with reduced training complexity.

 - **Abstract**
 Multi-scale Vision Transformer (ViT) has emerged as a powerful backbone for computer vision tasks, while the self-attention computation in Transformer scales quadratically w.r.t. the input patch number. Thus, existing solutions commonly employ down-sampling operations (e.g., average pooling) over keys/values to dramatically reduce the computational cost. In this work, we argue that such over-aggressive down-sampling design is not invertible and inevitably causes information dropping especially for high-frequency components in objects (e.g., texture details). Motivated by the wavelet theory, we construct a new Wavelet Vision Transformer (\textbf{Wave-ViT}) that formulates the invertible down-sampling with wavelet transforms and self-attention learning in a unified way. This proposal enables self-attention learning with lossless down-sampling over keys/values, facilitating the pursuing of a better efficiency-vs-accuracy trade-off. Furthermore, inverse wavelet transforms are leveraged to strengthen self-attention outputs by aggregating local contexts with enlarged receptive field. We validate the superiority of Wave-ViT through extensive experiments over multiple vision tasks (e.g., image recognition, object detection and instance segmentation). Its performances surpass state-of-the-art ViT backbones with comparable FLOPs. Source code is available at \url{https://github.com/YehLi/ImageNetModel}.

 - **Abstract**
 Natural Language Processing (NLP) inference is seeing increasing adoption by mobile applications, where on-device inference is desirable for crucially preserving user data privacy and avoiding network roundtrips. Yet, the unprecedented size of an NLP model stresses both latency and memory, the two key resources of a mobile device. To meet a target latency, holding the whole model in memory launches execution as soon as possible but increases one app's memory footprints by several times, limiting its benefits to only a few inferences before being recycled by mobile memory management. On the other hand, loading the model from storage on demand incurs a few seconds long IO, far exceeding the delay range satisfying to a user; pipelining layerwise model loading and execution does not hide IO either, due to the large skewness between IO and computation delays. To this end, we propose Speedy Transformer Inference (STI). Built on the key idea of maximizing IO/compute resource utilization on the most important parts of a model, STI reconciles the latency/memory tension via two novel techniques. First, model sharding. STI manages model parameters as independently tunable shards and profiles their importance to accuracy. Second, elastic pipeline planning with a preload buffer. STI instantiates an IO/computation pipeline and uses a small buffer for preload shards to bootstrap execution without stalling in early stages; it judiciously selects, tunes, and assembles shards per their importance for resource-elastic execution, which maximizes inference accuracy. Atop two commodity SoCs, we build STI and evaluate it against a wide range of NLP tasks, under a practical range of target latencies, and on both CPU and GPU. We demonstrate that, STI delivers high accuracies with 1--2 orders of magnitude lower memory, outperforming competitive baselines.

 Traversing intersections is a challenging problem for autonomous vehicles, especially when the intersections do not have traffic control. Recently deep reinforcement learning has received massive attention due to its success in dealing with autonomous driving tasks. In this work, we address the problem of traversing unsignalized intersections using a novel curriculum for deep reinforcement learning. The proposed curriculum leads to: 1) A faster training process for the reinforcement learning agent, and 2) Better performance compared to an agent trained without curriculum. Our main contribution is two-fold: 1) Presenting a unique curriculum for training deep reinforcement learning agents, and 2) showing the application of the proposed curriculum for the unsignalized intersection traversal task. The framework expects processed observations of the surroundings from the perception system of the autonomous vehicle. We test our method in the CommonRoad motion planning simulator on T-intersections and four-way intersections.

 - **Abstract**
 As camera and LiDAR sensors capture complementary information used in autonomous driving, great efforts have been made to develop semantic segmentation algorithms through multi-modality data fusion. However, fusion-based approaches require paired data, i.e., LiDAR point clouds and camera images with strict point-to-pixel mappings, as the inputs in both training and inference, which seriously hinders their application in practical scenarios. Thus, in this work, we propose the 2D Priors Assisted Semantic Segmentation (2DPASS), a general training scheme, to boost the representation learning on point clouds, by fully taking advantage of 2D images with rich appearance. In practice, by leveraging an auxiliary modal fusion and multi-scale fusion-to-single knowledge distillation (MSFSKD), 2DPASS acquires richer semantic and structural information from the multi-modal data, which are then online distilled to the pure 3D network. As a result, equipped with 2DPASS, our baseline shows significant improvement with only point cloud inputs. Specifically, it achieves the state-of-the-arts on two large-scale benchmarks (i.e. SemanticKITTI and NuScenes), including top-1 results in both single and multiple scan(s) competitions of SemanticKITTI.

 - **Abstract**
 Monocular 3D object detection is an essential perception task for autonomous driving. However, the high reliance on large-scale labeled data make it costly and time-consuming during model optimization. To reduce such over-reliance on human annotations, we propose Mix-Teaching, an effective semi-supervised learning framework applicable to employ both labeled and unlabeled images in training stage. Mix-Teaching first generates pseudo-labels for unlabeled images by self-training. The student model is then trained on the mixed images possessing much more intensive and precise labeling by merging instance-level image patches into empty backgrounds or labeled images. This is the first to break the image-level limitation and put high-quality pseudo labels from multi frames into one image for semi-supervised training. Besides, as a result of the misalignment between confidence score and localization quality, it's hard to discriminate high-quality pseudo-labels from noisy predictions using only confidence-based criterion. To that end, we further introduce an uncertainty-based filter to help select reliable pseudo boxes for the above mixing operation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first unified SSL framework for monocular 3D object detection. Mix-Teaching consistently improves MonoFlex and GUPNet by significant margins under various labeling ratios on KITTI dataset. For example, our method achieves around +6.34% AP@0.7 improvement against the GUPNet baseline on validation set when using only 10% labeled data. Besides, by leveraging full training set and the additional 48K raw images of KITTI, it can further improve the MonoFlex by +4.65% improvement on AP@0.7 for car detection, reaching 18.54% AP@0.7, which ranks the 1st place among all monocular based methods on KITTI test leaderboard. The code and pretrained models will be released at https://github.com/yanglei18/Mix-Teaching.

 - **Abstract**
 LiDAR-based 3D scene perception is a fundamental and important task for autonomous driving. Most state-of-the-art methods on LiDAR-based 3D recognition tasks focus on single frame 3D point cloud data, and the temporal information is ignored in those methods. We argue that the temporal information across the frames provides crucial knowledge for 3D scene perceptions, especially in the driving scenario. In this paper, we focus on spatial and temporal variations to better explore the temporal information across the 3D frames. We design a temporal variation-aware interpolation module and a temporal voxel-point refiner to capture the temporal variation in the 4D point cloud. The temporal variation-aware interpolation generates local features from the previous and current frames by capturing spatial coherence and temporal variation information. The temporal voxel-point refiner builds a temporal graph on the 3D point cloud sequences and captures the temporal variation with a graph convolution module. The temporal voxel-point refiner also transforms the coarse voxel-level predictions into fine point-level predictions. With our proposed modules, the new network TVSN achieves state-of-the-art performance on SemanticKITTI and SemantiPOSS. Specifically, our method achieves 52.5\% in mIoU (+5.5% against previous best approaches) on the multiple scan segmentation task on SemanticKITTI, and 63.0% on SemanticPOSS (+2.8% against previous best approaches).

 - **Abstract**
 Deep learning has substantially boosted the performance of Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE), a critical component in fully vision-based autonomous driving (AD) systems (e.g., Tesla and Toyota). In this work, we develop an attack against learning-based MDE. In particular, we use an optimization-based method to systematically generate stealthy physical-object-oriented adversarial patches to attack depth estimation. We balance the stealth and effectiveness of our attack with object-oriented adversarial design, sensitive region localization, and natural style camouflage. Using real-world driving scenarios, we evaluate our attack on concurrent MDE models and a representative downstream task for AD (i.e., 3D object detection). Experimental results show that our method can generate stealthy, effective, and robust adversarial patches for different target objects and models and achieves more than 6 meters mean depth estimation error and 93% attack success rate (ASR) in object detection with a patch of 1/9 of the vehicle's rear area. Field tests on three different driving routes with a real vehicle indicate that we cause over 6 meters mean depth estimation error and reduce the object detection rate from 90.70% to 5.16% in continuous video frames.

 - **Abstract**
 LiDAR sensors used in autonomous driving applications are negatively affected by adverse weather conditions. One common, but understudied effect, is the condensation of vehicle gas exhaust in cold weather. This everyday phenomenon can severely impact the quality of LiDAR measurements, resulting in a less accurate environment perception by creating artifacts like ghost object detections. In the literature, the semantic segmentation of adverse weather effects like rain and fog is achieved using learning-based approaches. However, such methods require large sets of labeled data, which can be extremely expensive and laborious to get. We address this problem by presenting a two-step approach for the detection of condensed vehicle gas exhaust. First, we identify for each vehicle in a scene its emission area and detect gas exhaust if present. Then, isolated clouds are detected by modeling through time the regions of space where gas exhaust is likely to be present. We test our method on real urban data, showing that our approach can reliably detect gas exhaust in different scenarios, making it appealing for offline pre-labeling and online applications such as ghost object detection.
