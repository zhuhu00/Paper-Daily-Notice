 - **Abstract**
 We present ESLAM, an efficient implicit neural representation method for Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). ESLAM reads RGB-D frames with unknown camera poses in a sequential manner and incrementally reconstructs the scene representation while estimating the current camera position in the scene. We incorporate the latest advances in Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) into a SLAM system, resulting in an efficient and accurate dense visual SLAM method. Our scene representation consists of multi-scale axis-aligned perpendicular feature planes and shallow decoders that, for each point in the continuous space, decode the interpolated features into Truncated Signed Distance Field (TSDF) and RGB values. Our extensive experiments on two standard and recent datasets, Replica and ScanNet, show that ESLAM improves the accuracy of 3D reconstruction and camera localization of state-of-the-art dense visual SLAM methods by more than 50%, while it runs up to $\times$10 faster and does not require any pre-training.

 - **Abstract**
 Video-based gait recognition has achieved impressive results in constrained scenarios. However, visual cameras neglect human 3D structure information, which limits the feasibility of gait recognition in the 3D wild world. In this work, instead of extracting gait features from images, we explore precise 3D gait features from point clouds and propose a simple yet efficient 3D gait recognition framework, termed multi-view projection network (MVPNet). MVPNet first projects point clouds into multiple depth maps from different perspectives, and then fuse depth images together, to learn the compact representation with 3D geometry information. Due to the lack of point cloud datasets, we build the first large-scale Lidar-based gait recognition dataset, LIDAR GAIT, collected by a Lidar sensor and an RGB camera mounted on a robot. The dataset contains 25,279 sequences from 1,050 subjects and covers many different variations, including visibility, views, occlusions, clothing, carrying, and scenes. Extensive experiments show that, (1) 3D structure information serves as a significant feature for gait recognition. (2) MVPNet not only competes with five representative point-based methods, but it also outperforms existing camera-based methods by large margins. (3) The Lidar sensor is superior to the RGB camera for gait recognition in the wild. LIDAR GAIT dataset and MVPNet code will be publicly available.

 - **Abstract**
 The emergence of low-cost, small form factor and light-weight solid-state LiDAR sensors have brought new opportunities for autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) by advancing navigation safety and computation efficiency. Yet the successful developments of LiDAR-based UAVs must rely on extensive simulations. Existing simulators can hardly perform simulations of real-world environments due to the requirements of dense mesh maps that are difficult to obtain. In this paper, we develop a point-realistic simulator of real-world scenes for LiDAR-based UAVs. The key idea is the underlying point rendering method, where we construct a depth image directly from the point cloud map and interpolate it to obtain realistic LiDAR point measurements. Our developed simulator is able to run on a light-weight computing platform and supports the simulation of LiDARs with different resolution and scanning patterns, dynamic obstacles, and multi-UAV systems. Developed in the ROS framework, the simulator can easily communicate with other key modules of an autonomous robot, such as perception, state estimation, planning, and control. Finally, the simulator provides 10 high-resolution point cloud maps of various real-world environments, including forests of different densities, historic building, office, parking garage, and various complex indoor environments. These realistic maps provide diverse testing scenarios for an autonomous UAV. Evaluation results show that the developed simulator achieves superior performance in terms of time and memory consumption against Gazebo and that the simulated UAV flights highly match the actual one in real-world environments. We believe such a point-realistic and light-weight simulator is crucial to bridge the gap between UAV simulation and experiments and will significantly facilitate the research of LiDAR-based autonomous UAVs in the future.

 - **Abstract**
 For 3D object detection, labeling lidar point cloud is difficult, so data augmentation is an important module to make full use of precious annotated data. As a widely used data augmentation method, GT-sample effectively improves detection performance by inserting groundtruths into the lidar frame during training. However, these samples are often placed in unreasonable areas, which misleads model to learn the wrong context information between targets and backgrounds. To address this problem, in this paper, we propose a context-aware data augmentation method (CA-aug) , which ensures the reasonable placement of inserted objects by calculating the "Validspace" of the lidar point cloud. CA-aug is lightweight and compatible with other augmentation methods. Compared with the GT-sample and the similar method in Lidar-aug(SOTA), it brings higher accuracy to the existing detectors. We also present an in-depth study of augmentation methods for the range-view-based(RV-based) models and find that CA-aug can fully exploit the potential of RV-based networks. The experiment on KITTI val split shows that CA-aug can improve the mAP of the test model by 8%.
### DesNet: Decomposed Scale-Consistent Network for Unsupervised Depth  Completion

 - **Abstract**
 Unsupervised depth completion aims to recover dense depth from the sparse one without using the ground-truth annotation. Although depth measurement obtained from LiDAR is usually sparse, it contains valid and real distance information, i.e., scale-consistent absolute depth values. Meanwhile, scale-agnostic counterparts seek to estimate relative depth and have achieved impressive performance. To leverage both the inherent characteristics, we thus suggest to model scale-consistent depth upon unsupervised scale-agnostic frameworks. Specifically, we propose the decomposed scale-consistent learning (DSCL) strategy, which disintegrates the absolute depth into relative depth prediction and global scale estimation, contributing to individual learning benefits. But unfortunately, most existing unsupervised scale-agnostic frameworks heavily suffer from depth holes due to the extremely sparse depth input and weak supervised signal. To tackle this issue, we introduce the global depth guidance (GDG) module, which attentively propagates dense depth reference into the sparse target via novel dense-to-sparse attention. Extensive experiments show the superiority of our method on outdoor KITTI benchmark, ranking 1st and outperforming the best KBNet more than 12% in RMSE. In addition, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on indoor NYUv2 dataset.
### CoPEM: Cooperative Perception Error Models for Autonomous Driving

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.11175
 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we introduce the notion of Cooperative Perception Error Models (coPEMs) towards achieving an effective and efficient integration of V2X solutions within a virtual test environment. We focus our analysis on the occlusion problem in the (onboard) perception of Autonomous Vehicles (AV), which can manifest as misdetection errors on the occluded objects. Cooperative perception (CP) solutions based on Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communications aim to avoid such issues by cooperatively leveraging additional points of view for the world around the AV. This approach usually requires many sensors, mainly cameras and LiDARs, to be deployed simultaneously in the environment either as part of the road infrastructure or on other traffic vehicles. However, implementing a large number of sensor models in a virtual simulation pipeline is often prohibitively computationally expensive. Therefore, in this paper, we rely on extending Perception Error Models (PEMs) to efficiently implement such cooperative perception solutions along with the errors and uncertainties associated with them. We demonstrate the approach by comparing the safety achievable by an AV challenged with a traffic scenario where occlusion is the primary cause of a potential collision.

 - **Abstract**
 Planes are generally used in 3D reconstruction for depth sensors, such as RGB-D cameras and LiDARs. This paper focuses on the problem of estimating the optimal planes and sensor poses to minimize the point-to-plane distance. The resulting least-squares problem is referred to as plane adjustment (PA) in the literature, which is the counterpart of bundle adjustment (BA) in visual reconstruction. Iterative methods are adopted to solve these least-squares problems. Typically, Newton's method is rarely used for a large-scale least-squares problem, due to the high computational complexity of the Hessian matrix. Instead, methods using an approximation of the Hessian matrix, such as the Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) method, are generally adopted. This paper challenges this ingrained idea. We adopt the Newton's method to efficiently solve the PA problem. Specifically, given poses, the optimal planes have close-form solutions. Thus we can eliminate planes from the cost function, which significantly reduces the number of variables. Furthermore, as the optimal planes are functions of poses, this method actually ensures that the optimal planes for the current estimated poses can be obtained at each iteration, which benefits the convergence. The difficulty lies in how to efficiently compute the Hessian matrix and the gradient of the resulting cost. This paper provides an efficient solution. Empirical evaluation shows that our algorithm converges significantly faster than the widely used LM algorithm.

### DynIBaR: Neural Dynamic Image-Based Rendering

 - **Abstract**
 We address the problem of synthesizing novel views from a monocular video depicting a complex dynamic scene. State-of-the-art methods based on temporally varying Neural Radiance Fields (aka dynamic NeRFs) have shown impressive results on this task. However, for long videos with complex object motions and uncontrolled camera trajectories, these methods can produce blurry or inaccurate renderings, hampering their use in real-world applications. Instead of encoding the entire dynamic scene within the weights of an MLP, we present a new approach that addresses these limitations by adopting a volumetric image-based rendering framework that synthesizes new viewpoints by aggregating features from nearby views in a scene-motion-aware manner. Our system retains the advantages of prior methods in its ability to model complex scenes and view-dependent effects, but also enables synthesizing photo-realistic novel views from long videos featuring complex scene dynamics with unconstrained camera trajectories. We demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods on dynamic scene datasets, and also apply our approach to in-the-wild videos with challenging camera and object motion, where prior methods fail to produce high-quality renderings.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.11202
 - **Abstract**
 This paper presents the first significant work on directly predicting 3D face landmarks on neural radiance fields (NeRFs), without using intermediate representations such as 2D images, depth maps, or point clouds. Our 3D coarse-to-fine Face Landmarks NeRF (FLNeRF) model efficiently samples from the NeRF on the whole face with individual facial features for accurate landmarks. To mitigate the limited number of facial expressions in the available data, local and non-linear NeRF warp is applied at facial features in fine scale to simulate large emotions range, including exaggerated facial expressions (e.g., cheek blowing, wide opening mouth, eye blinking), for training FLNeRF. With such expression augmentation, our model can predict 3D landmarks not limited to the 20 discrete expressions given in the data. Robust 3D NeRF facial landmarks contribute to many downstream tasks. As an example, we modify MoFaNeRF to enable high-quality face editing and swapping using face landmarks on NeRF, allowing more direct control and wider range of complex expressions. Experiments show that the improved model using landmarks achieves comparable to better results. Github link: https://github.com/ZHANG1023/FLNeRF.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent advances in Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) boast impressive performances for generative tasks such as novel view synthesis and 3D reconstruction. Methods based on neural radiance fields are able to represent the 3D world implicitly by relying exclusively on posed images. Yet, they have seldom been explored in the realm of discriminative tasks such as 3D part segmentation.In this work, we attempt to bridge that gap by proposing SegNeRF: a neural field representation that integrates a semantic field along with the usual radiance field. SegNeRF inherits from previous works the ability to perform novel view synthesis and 3D reconstruction, and enables 3D part segmentation from a few images. Our extensive experiments on PartNet show that SegNeRF is capable of simultaneously predicting geometry, appearance, and semantic information from posed images, even for unseen objects. The predicted semantic fields allow SegNeRF to achieve an average mIoU of $\textbf{30.30%}$ for 2D novel view segmentation, and $\textbf{37.46%}$ for 3D part segmentation, boasting competitive performance against point-based methods by using only a few posed images. Additionally, SegNeRF is able to generate an explicit 3D model from a single image of an object taken in the wild, with its corresponding part segmentation.

 - **Abstract**
 Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have achieved photorealistic novel views synthesis; however, the requirement of accurate camera poses limits its application. Despite analysis-by-synthesis extensions for jointly learning neural 3D representations and registering camera frames exist, they are susceptible to suboptimal solutions if poorly initialized. We propose L2G-NeRF, a Local-to-Global registration method for bundle-adjusting Neural Radiance Fields: first, a pixel-wise flexible alignment, followed by a frame-wise constrained parametric alignment. Pixel-wise local alignment is learned in an unsupervised way via a deep network which optimizes photometric reconstruction errors. Frame-wise global alignment is performed using differentiable parameter estimation solvers on the pixel-wise correspondences to find a global transformation. Experiments on synthetic and real-world data show that our method outperforms the current state-of-the-art in terms of high-fidelity reconstruction and resolving large camera pose misalignment. Our module is an easy-to-use plugin that can be applied to NeRF variants and other neural field applications.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper presents the first significant object detection framework, NeRF-RPN, which directly operates on NeRF. Given a pre-trained NeRF model, NeRF-RPN aims to detect all bounding boxes of objects in a scene. By exploiting a novel voxel representation that incorporates multi-scale 3D neural volumetric features, we demonstrate it is possible to regress the 3D bounding boxes of objects in NeRF directly without rendering the NeRF at any viewpoint. NeRF-RPN is a general framework and can be applied to detect objects without class labels. We experimented the NeRF-RPN with various backbone architectures, RPN head designs and loss functions. All of them can be trained in an end-to-end manner to estimate high quality 3D bounding boxes. To facilitate future research in object detection for NeRF, we built a new benchmark dataset which consists of both synthetic and real-world data with careful labeling and clean up. Please watch the \href{https://youtu.be/M8_4Ih1CJjE}{video} for visualizing the 3D region proposals by our NeRF-RPN. Code and dataset will be made available.

 - **Abstract**
 Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) coupled with GANs represent a promising direction in the area of 3D reconstruction from a single view, owing to their ability to efficiently model arbitrary topologies. Recent work in this area, however, has mostly focused on synthetic datasets where exact ground-truth poses are known, and has overlooked pose estimation, which is important for certain downstream applications such as augmented reality (AR) and robotics. We introduce a principled end-to-end reconstruction framework for natural images, where accurate ground-truth poses are not available. Our approach recovers an SDF-parameterized 3D shape, pose, and appearance from a single image of an object, without exploiting multiple views during training. More specifically, we leverage an unconditional 3D-aware generator, to which we apply a hybrid inversion scheme where a model produces a first guess of the solution which is then refined via optimization. Our framework can de-render an image in as few as 10 steps, enabling its use in practical scenarios. We demonstrate state-of-the-art results on a variety of real and synthetic benchmarks.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.11738
 - **Abstract**
 Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) has recently emerged as a powerful representation to synthesize photorealistic novel views. While showing impressive performance, it relies on the availability of dense input views with highly accurate camera poses, thus limiting its application in real-world scenarios. In this work, we introduce Sparse Pose Adjusting Radiance Field (SPARF), to address the challenge of novel-view synthesis given only few wide-baseline input images (as low as 3) with noisy camera poses. Our approach exploits multi-view geometry constraints in order to jointly learn the NeRF and refine the camera poses. By relying on pixel matches extracted between the input views, our multi-view correspondence objective enforces the optimized scene and camera poses to converge to a global and geometrically accurate solution. Our depth consistency loss further encourages the reconstructed scene to be consistent from any viewpoint. Our approach sets a new state of the art in the sparse-view regime on multiple challenging datasets.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.10821
 - **Abstract**
 Analogical reasoning is the process of discovering and mapping correspondences from a target subject to a base subject. As the most well-known computational method of analogical reasoning, Structure-Mapping Theory (SMT) abstracts both target and base subjects into relational graphs and forms the cognitive process of analogical reasoning by finding a corresponding subgraph (i.e., correspondence) in the target graph that is aligned with the base graph. However, incorporating deep learning for SMT is still under-explored due to several obstacles: 1) the combinatorial complexity of searching for the correspondence in the target graph; 2) the correspondence mining is restricted by various cognitive theory-driven constraints. To address both challenges, we propose a novel framework for Analogical Reasoning (DeepGAR) that identifies the correspondence between source and target domains by assuring cognitive theory-driven constraints. Specifically, we design a geometric constraint embedding space to induce subgraph relation from node embeddings for efficient subgraph search. Furthermore, we develop novel learning and optimization strategies that could end-to-end identify correspondences that are strictly consistent with constraints driven by the cognitive theory. Extensive experiments are conducted on synthetic and real-world datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DeepGAR over existing methods.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.10902
 - **Abstract**
 Natural and formal languages provide an effective mechanism for humans to specify instructions and reward functions. We investigate how to generate policies via RL when reward functions are specified in a symbolic language captured by Reward Machines, an increasingly popular automaton-inspired structure. We are interested in the case where the mapping of environment state to a symbolic (here, Reward Machine) vocabulary -- commonly known as the labelling function -- is uncertain from the perspective of the agent. We formulate the problem of policy learning in Reward Machines with noisy symbolic abstractions as a special class of POMDP optimization problem, and investigate several methods to address the problem, building on existing and new techniques, the latter focused on predicting Reward Machine state, rather than on grounding of individual symbols. We analyze these methods and evaluate them experimentally under varying degrees of uncertainty in the correct interpretation of the symbolic vocabulary. We verify the strength of our approach and the limitation of existing methods via an empirical investigation on both illustrative, toy domains and partially observable, deep RL domains.

 - **Abstract**
 Autonomous robots are required to actively and adaptively learn the categories and words of various places by exploring the surrounding environment and interacting with users. In semantic mapping and spatial language acquisition conducted using robots, it is costly and labor-intensive to prepare training datasets that contain linguistic instructions from users. Therefore, we aimed to enable mobile robots to learn spatial concepts through autonomous active exploration. This study is characterized by interpreting the `action' of the robot that asks the user the question `What kind of place is this?' in the context of active inference. We propose an active inference method, spatial concept formation with information gain-based active exploration (SpCoAE), that combines sequential Bayesian inference by particle filters and position determination based on information gain in a probabilistic generative model. Our experiment shows that the proposed method can efficiently determine a position to form appropriate spatial concepts in home environments. In particular, it is important to conduct efficient exploration that leads to appropriate concept formation and quickly covers the environment without adopting a haphazard exploration strategy.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.10946
 - **Abstract**
 Video anomaly detection is an ill-posed problem because it relies on many parameters such as appearance, pose, camera angle, background, and more. We distill the problem to anomaly detection of human pose, thus reducing the risk of nuisance parameters such as appearance affecting the result. Focusing on pose alone also has the side benefit of reducing bias against distinct minority groups. Our model works directly on human pose graph sequences and is exceptionally lightweight ($\sim1K$ parameters), capable of running on any machine able to run the pose estimation with negligible additional resources. We leverage the highly compact pose representation in a normalizing flows framework, which we extend to tackle the unique characteristics of spatio-temporal pose data and show its advantages in this use case. Our algorithm uses normalizing flows to learn a bijective mapping between the pose data distribution and a Gaussian distribution, using spatio-temporal graph convolution blocks. The algorithm is quite general and can handle training data of only normal examples, as well as a supervised dataset that consists of labeled normal and abnormal examples. We report state-of-the-art results on two anomaly detection benchmarks - the unsupervised ShanghaiTech dataset and the recent supervised UBnormal dataset.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.10999
 - **Abstract**
 Audio-visual speech enhancement aims to extract clean speech from a noisy environment by leveraging not only the audio itself but also the target speaker's lip movements. This approach has been shown to yield improvements over audio-only speech enhancement, particularly for the removal of interfering speech. Despite recent advances in speech synthesis, most audio-visual approaches continue to use spectral mapping/masking to reproduce the clean audio, often resulting in visual backbones added to existing speech enhancement architectures. In this work, we propose LA-VocE, a new two-stage approach that predicts mel-spectrograms from noisy audio-visual speech via a transformer-based architecture, and then converts them into waveform audio using a neural vocoder (HiFi-GAN). We train and evaluate our framework on thousands of speakers and 11+ different languages, and study our model's ability to adapt to different levels of background noise and speech interference. Our experiments show that LA-VocE outperforms existing methods according to multiple metrics, particularly under very noisy scenarios.

 - **Abstract**
 A common problem in time series analysis is to predict dynamics with only scalar or partial observations of the underlying dynamical system. For data on a smooth compact manifold, Takens theorem proves a time delayed embedding of the partial state is diffeomorphic to the attractor, although for chaotic and highly nonlinear systems learning these delay coordinate mappings is challenging. We utilize deep artificial neural networks (ANNs) to learn discrete discrete time maps and continuous time flows of the partial state. Given training data for the full state, we also learn a reconstruction map. Thus, predictions of a time series can be made from the current state and several previous observations with embedding parameters determined from time series analysis. The state space for time evolution is of comparable dimension to reduced order manifold models. These are advantages over recurrent neural network models, which require a high dimensional internal state or additional memory terms and hyperparameters. We demonstrate the capacity of deep ANNs to predict chaotic behavior from a scalar observation on a manifold of dimension three via the Lorenz system. We also consider multivariate observations on the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, where the observation dimension required for accurately reproducing dynamics increases with the manifold dimension via the spatial extent of the system.

 This paper presents an end-to-end neural mapping method for camera localization, encoding a whole scene into a grid of latent codes, with which a Transformer-based auto-decoder regresses 3D coordinates of query pixels. State-of-the-art camera localization methods require each scene to be stored as a 3D point cloud with per-point features, which takes several gigabytes of storage per scene. While compression is possible, the performance drops significantly at high compression rates. NeuMap achieves extremely high compression rates with minimal performance drop by using 1) learnable latent codes to store scene information and 2) a scene-agnostic Transformer-based auto-decoder to infer coordinates for a query pixel. The scene-agnostic network design also learns robust matching priors by training with large-scale data, and further allows us to just optimize the codes quickly for a new scene while fixing the network weights. Extensive evaluations with five benchmarks show that NeuMap outperforms all the other coordinate regression methods significantly and reaches similar performance as the feature matching methods while having a much smaller scene representation size. For example, NeuMap achieves 39.1% accuracy in Aachen night benchmark with only 6MB of data, while other compelling methods require 100MB or a few gigabytes and fail completely under high compression settings.

 - **Abstract**
 Laser scanning can provide timely assessments of mine sites despite adverse challenges in the operational environment. Although there are several published articles on laser scanning, there is a need to review them in the context of underground mining applications. To this end, a holistic review of laser scanning is presented including progress in 3D scanning systems, data capture/processing techniques and primary applications in underground mines. Laser scanning technology has advanced significantly in terms of mobility and mapping, but there are constraints in coherent and consistent data collection at certain mines due to feature deficiency, dynamics, and environmental influences such as dust and water. Studies suggest that laser scanning has matured over the years for change detection, clearance measurements and structure mapping applications. However, there is scope for improvements in lithology identification, surface parameter measurements, logistic tracking and autonomous navigation. Laser scanning has the potential to provide real-time solutions but the lack of infrastructure in underground mines for data transfer, geodetic networking and processing capacity remain limiting factors. Nevertheless, laser scanners are becoming an integral part of mine automation thanks to their affordability, accuracy and mobility, which should support their widespread usage in years to come.

 - **Abstract**
 Autonomous robots that interact with their environment require a detailed semantic scene model. For this, volumetric semantic maps are frequently used. The scene understanding can further be improved by including object-level information in the map. In this work, we extend a multi-view 3D semantic mapping system consisting of a network of distributed smart edge sensors with object-level information, to enable downstream tasks that need object-level input. Objects are represented in the map via their 3D mesh model or as an object-centric volumetric sub-map that can model arbitrary object geometry when no detailed 3D model is available. We propose a keypoint-based approach to estimate object poses via PnP and refinement via ICP alignment of the 3D object model with the observed point cloud segments. Object instances are tracked to integrate observations over time and to be robust against temporary occlusions. Our method is evaluated on the public Behave dataset where it shows pose estimation accuracy within a few centimeters and in real-world experiments with the sensor network in a challenging lab environment where multiple chairs and a table are tracked through the scene online, in real time even under high occlusions.

 - **Abstract**
 The knowledge of the world is passed on through libraries. Accordingly, domain expertise and experiences should also be transferred within an enterprise by a knowledge base. Therefore, models are an established medium to describe good practices for complex systems, processes, and interconnections. However, there is no structured and detailed approach for a design of an enterprise model library. The objective of this work is the reference architecture of a repository for models with function of reuse. It includes the design of the data structure for filing, the processes for administration and possibilities for usage. Our approach enables consistent mapping of requirements into models via meta-data attributes. Furthermore, the adaptation of reference architectures in specific use cases as well as a reconciliation of interrelationships is enabled. A case study with industry demonstrates the practical benefits of reusing work already done. It provides an organization with systematic access to specifications, standards and guidelines. Thus, further development is accelerated and supported in a structured manner, while complexity remains controllable. The presented approach enriches various enterprise architecture frameworks. It provides benefits for development based on models.

 - **Abstract**
 Streamflow observation data is vital for flood monitoring, agricultural, and settlement planning. However, such streamflow data are commonly plagued with missing observations due to various causes such as harsh environmental conditions and constrained operational resources. This problem is often more pervasive in under-resourced areas such as Sub-Saharan Africa. In this work, we reconstruct streamflow time series data through bias correction of the GEOGloWS ECMWF streamflow service (GESS) forecasts at ten river gauging stations in Benin Republic. We perform bias correction by fitting Quantile Mapping, Gaussian Process, and Elastic Net regression in a constrained training period. We show by simulating missingness in a testing period that GESS forecasts have a significant bias that results in low predictive skill over the ten Beninese stations. Our findings suggest that overall bias correction by Elastic Net and Gaussian Process regression achieves superior skill relative to traditional imputation by Random Forest, k-Nearest Neighbour, and GESS lookup. The findings of this work provide a basis for integrating global GESS streamflow data into operational early-warning decision-making systems (e.g., flood alert) in countries vulnerable to drought and flooding due to extreme weather events.

 - **Abstract**
 Conditional imitation learning (CIL) trains deep neural networks, in an end-to-end manner, to mimic human driving. This approach has demonstrated suitable vehicle control when following roads, avoiding obstacles, or taking specific turns at intersections to reach a destination. Unfortunately, performance dramatically decreases when deployed to unseen environments and is inconsistent against varying weather conditions. Most importantly, the current CIL fails to avoid static road blockages. In this work, we propose a solution to those deficiencies. First, we fuse the laser scanner with the regular camera streams, at the features level, to overcome the generalization and consistency challenges. Second, we introduce a new efficient Occupancy Grid Mapping (OGM) method along with new algorithms for road blockages avoidance and global route planning. Consequently, our proposed method dynamically detects partial and full road blockages, and guides the controlled vehicle to another route to reach the destination. Following the original CIL work, we demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposal on CARLA simulator urban driving benchmark. Our experiments showed that our model improved consistency against weather conditions by four times and autonomous driving success rate generalization by 52%. Furthermore, our global route planner improved the driving success rate by 37%. Our proposed road blockages avoidance algorithm improved the driving success rate by 27%. Finally, the average kilometers traveled before a collision with a static object increased by 1.5 times.

### Understanding and Improving Visual Prompting: A Label-Mapping  Perspective

 - **Abstract**
 We revisit and advance visual prompting (VP), an input prompting technique for vision tasks. VP can reprogram a fixed, pre-trained source model to accomplish downstream tasks in the target domain by simply incorporating universal prompts (in terms of input perturbation patterns) into downstream data points. Yet, it remains elusive why VP stays effective even given a ruleless label mapping (LM) between the source classes and the target classes. Inspired by the above, we ask: How is LM interrelated with VP? And how to exploit such a relationship to improve its accuracy on target tasks? We peer into the influence of LM on VP and provide an affirmative answer that a better 'quality' of LM (assessed by mapping precision and explanation) can consistently improve the effectiveness of VP. This is in contrast to the prior art where the factor of LM was missing. To optimize LM, we propose a new VP framework, termed ILM-VP (iterative label mapping-based visual prompting), which automatically re-maps the source labels to the target labels and progressively improves the target task accuracy of VP. Further, when using a contrastive language-image pretrained (CLIP) model, we propose to integrate an LM process to assist the text prompt selection of CLIP and to improve the target task accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposal significantly outperforms state-of-the-art VP methods. As highlighted below, we show that when reprogramming an ImageNet-pretrained ResNet-18 to 13 target tasks, our method outperforms baselines by a substantial margin, e.g., 7.9% and 6.7% accuracy improvements in transfer learning to the target Flowers102 and CIFAR100 datasets. Besides, our proposal on CLIP-based VP provides 13.7% and 7.1% accuracy improvements on Flowers102 and DTD respectively. Our code is available at https://github.com/OPTML-Group/ILM-VP.

 - **Abstract**
 We present ESLAM, an efficient implicit neural representation method for Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). ESLAM reads RGB-D frames with unknown camera poses in a sequential manner and incrementally reconstructs the scene representation while estimating the current camera position in the scene. We incorporate the latest advances in Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) into a SLAM system, resulting in an efficient and accurate dense visual SLAM method. Our scene representation consists of multi-scale axis-aligned perpendicular feature planes and shallow decoders that, for each point in the continuous space, decode the interpolated features into Truncated Signed Distance Field (TSDF) and RGB values. Our extensive experiments on two standard and recent datasets, Replica and ScanNet, show that ESLAM improves the accuracy of 3D reconstruction and camera localization of state-of-the-art dense visual SLAM methods by more than 50%, while it runs up to $\times$10 faster and does not require any pre-training.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper deals with the problem of localizing objects in image and video datasets from visual exemplars. In particular, we focus on the challenging problem of egocentric visual query localization. We first identify grave implicit biases in current query-conditioned model design and visual query datasets. Then, we directly tackle such biases at both frame and object set levels. Concretely, our method solves these issues by expanding limited annotations and dynamically dropping object proposals during training. Additionally, we propose a novel transformer-based module that allows for object-proposal set context to be considered while incorporating query information. We name our module Conditioned Contextual Transformer or CocoFormer. Our experiments show the proposed adaptations improve egocentric query detection, leading to a better visual query localization system in both 2D and 3D configurations. Thus, we are able to improve frame-level detection performance from 26.28% to 31.26 in AP, which correspondingly improves the VQ2D and VQ3D localization scores by significant margins. Our improved context-aware query object detector ranked first and second in the VQ2D and VQ3D tasks in the 2nd Ego4D challenge. In addition to this, we showcase the relevance of our proposed model in the Few-Shot Detection (FSD) task, where we also achieve SOTA results.

 - **Abstract**
 Wi-Fi fingerprinting becomes a dominant solution for large-scale indoor localization due to its major advantage of not requiring new infrastructure and dedicated devices. The number and the distribution of Reference Points (RPs) for the measurement of localization fingerprints like RSSI during the offline phase, however, greatly affects the localization accuracy; for instance, the UJIIndoorLoc is known to have the issue of uneven spatial distribution of RPs over buildings and floors. Data augmentation has been proposed as a feasible solution to not only improve the smaller number and the uneven distribution of RPs in the existing fingerprint databases but also reduce the labor and time costs of constructing new fingerprint databases. In this paper, we propose the multidimensional augmentation of fingerprint data for indoor localization in a large-scale building complex based on Multi-Output Gaussian Process (MOGP) and systematically investigate the impact of augmentation ratio as well as MOGP kernel functions and models with their hyperparameters on the performance of indoor localization using the UJIIndoorLoc database and the state-of-the-art neural network indoor localization model based on a hierarchical RNN. The investigation based on experimental results suggests that we can generate synthetic RSSI fingerprint data up to ten times the original data -- i.e., the augmentation ratio of 10 -- through the proposed multidimensional MOGP-based data augmentation without significantly affecting the indoor localization performance compared to that of the original data alone, which extends the spatial coverage of the combined RPs and thereby could improve the localization performance at the locations that are not part of the test dataset.

 - **Abstract**
 Combining the Color and Event cameras (also called Dynamic Vision Sensors, DVS) for robust object tracking is a newly emerging research topic in recent years. Existing color-event tracking framework usually contains multiple scattered modules which may lead to low efficiency and high computational complexity, including feature extraction, fusion, matching, interactive learning, etc. In this paper, we propose a single-stage backbone network for Color-Event Unified Tracking (CEUTrack), which achieves the above functions simultaneously. Given the event points and RGB frames, we first transform the points into voxels and crop the template and search regions for both modalities, respectively. Then, these regions are projected into tokens and parallelly fed into the unified Transformer backbone network. The output features will be fed into a tracking head for target object localization. Our proposed CEUTrack is simple, effective, and efficient, which achieves over 75 FPS and new SOTA performance. To better validate the effectiveness of our model and address the data deficiency of this task, we also propose a generic and large-scale benchmark dataset for color-event tracking, termed COESOT, which contains 90 categories and 1354 video sequences. Additionally, a new evaluation metric named BOC is proposed in our evaluation toolkit to evaluate the prominence with respect to the baseline methods. We hope the newly proposed method, dataset, and evaluation metric provide a better platform for color-event-based tracking. The dataset, toolkit, and source code will be released on: \url{https://github.com/Event-AHU/COESOT}.

 - **Abstract**
 Contrastive learning is a form of distance learning that aims to learn invariant features from two related representations. In this paper, we explore the bold hypothesis that an image and its caption can be simply regarded as two different views of the underlying mutual information, and train a model to learn a unified vision-language representation space that encodes both modalities at once in a modality-agnostic manner. We first identify difficulties in learning a generic one-tower model for vision-language pretraining (VLP), and propose OneR as a simple yet effective framework for our goal. We discover intriguing properties that distinguish OneR from the previous works that learn modality-specific representation spaces such as zero-shot object localization, text-guided visual reasoning and multi-modal retrieval, and present analyses to provide insights into this new form of multi-modal representation learning. Thorough evaluations demonstrate the potential of a unified modality-agnostic VLP framework.

 This paper presents an end-to-end neural mapping method for camera localization, encoding a whole scene into a grid of latent codes, with which a Transformer-based auto-decoder regresses 3D coordinates of query pixels. State-of-the-art camera localization methods require each scene to be stored as a 3D point cloud with per-point features, which takes several gigabytes of storage per scene. While compression is possible, the performance drops significantly at high compression rates. NeuMap achieves extremely high compression rates with minimal performance drop by using 1) learnable latent codes to store scene information and 2) a scene-agnostic Transformer-based auto-decoder to infer coordinates for a query pixel. The scene-agnostic network design also learns robust matching priors by training with large-scale data, and further allows us to just optimize the codes quickly for a new scene while fixing the network weights. Extensive evaluations with five benchmarks show that NeuMap outperforms all the other coordinate regression methods significantly and reaches similar performance as the feature matching methods while having a much smaller scene representation size. For example, NeuMap achieves 39.1% accuracy in Aachen night benchmark with only 6MB of data, while other compelling methods require 100MB or a few gigabytes and fail completely under high compression settings.

 - **Abstract**
 Camera relocalization has various applications in autonomous driving. Previous camera pose regression models consider only ideal scenarios where there is little environmental perturbation. To deal with challenging driving environments that may have changing seasons, weather, illumination, and the presence of unstable objects, we propose RobustLoc, which derives its robustness against perturbations from neural differential equations. Our model uses a convolutional neural network to extract feature maps from multi-view images, a robust neural differential equation diffusion block module to diffuse information interactively, and a branched pose decoder with multi-layer training to estimate the vehicle poses. Experiments demonstrate that RobustLoc surpasses current state-of-the-art camera pose regression models and achieves robust performance in various environments. Our code is released at: https://github.com/sijieaaa/RobustLoc

 - **Abstract**
 Weakly supervised temporal action localization (WTAL) aims to localize actions in untrimmed videos with only weak supervision information (e.g. video-level labels). Most existing models handle all input videos with a fixed temporal scale. However, such models are not sensitive to actions whose pace of the movements is different from the ``normal" speed, especially slow-motion action instances, which complete the movements with a much slower speed than their counterparts with a normal speed. Here arises the slow-motion blurred issue: It is hard to explore salient slow-motion information from videos at ``normal" speed. In this paper, we propose a novel framework termed Slow Motion Enhanced Network (SMEN) to improve the ability of a WTAL network by compensating its sensitivity on slow-motion action segments. The proposed SMEN comprises a Mining module and a Localization module. The mining module generates mask to mine slow-motion-related features by utilizing the relationships between the normal motion and slow motion; while the localization module leverages the mined slow-motion features as complementary information to improve the temporal action localization results. Our proposed framework can be easily adapted by existing WTAL networks and enable them be more sensitive to slow-motion actions. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks are conducted, which demonstrate the high performance of our proposed framework.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.11381
 - **Abstract**
 We present a novel framework, Localized Image Stylization with Audio (LISA) which performs audio-driven localized image stylization. Sound often provides information about the specific context of the scene and is closely related to a certain part of the scene or object. However, existing image stylization works have focused on stylizing the entire image using an image or text input. Stylizing a particular part of the image based on audio input is natural but challenging. In this work, we propose a framework that a user provides an audio input to localize the sound source in the input image and another for locally stylizing the target object or scene. LISA first produces a delicate localization map with an audio-visual localization network by leveraging CLIP embedding space. We then utilize implicit neural representation (INR) along with the predicted localization map to stylize the target object or scene based on sound information. The proposed INR can manipulate the localized pixel values to be semantically consistent with the provided audio input. Through a series of experiments, we show that the proposed framework outperforms the other audio-guided stylization methods. Moreover, LISA constructs concise localization maps and naturally manipulates the target object or scene in accordance with the given audio input.

 - **Abstract**
 The recent development of integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) technology offers new opportunities to meet high-throughput and low-latency communication as well as high-resolution localization requirements in vehicular networks. However, considering the limited transmit power of the road site units (RSUs) and the relatively small radar cross section (RCS) of vehicles with random reflection coefficients, the power of echo signals may be too weak to be utilized for effective target detection and tracking. Moreover, high-frequency signals usually suffer from large fading loss when penetrating vehicles, which seriously degrades the quality of communication services inside the vehicles. To handle this issue, we propose a novel sensing-assisted communication mechanism by employing an intelligent omni-surface (IOS) on the surface of vehicles to enhance both sensing and communication (S&C) performance. To this end, we first propose a two-stage ISAC protocol, including the joint S&C stage and the communication-only stage, to fulfill more efficient communication performance improvements benefited from sensing. The achievable communication rate maximization problem is formulated by jointly optimizing the transmit beamforming, the IOS phase shifts, and the duration of the joint S&C stage. However, solving this ISAC optimization problem is highly non-trivial since inaccurate estimation and measurement information renders the achievable rate lack of closed-form expression. To handle this issue, we first derive a closed-form expression of the achievable rate under uncertain location information, and then unveil a sufficient and necessary condition for the existence of the joint S&C stage to offer useful insights for practical system design. Moreover, two typical scenarios including interference-limited and noise-limited cases are analyzed.

 - **Abstract**
 Fault localization, aiming at localizing the root cause of the bug under repair, has been a longstanding research topic. Although many approaches have been proposed in the last decades, most of the existing studies work at coarse-grained statement or method levels with very limited insights about how to repair the bug (granularity problem), but few studies target the finer-grained fault localization. In this paper, we target the granularity problem and propose a novel finer-grained variable-level fault localization technique. Specifically, we design a program-dependency-enhanced decision tree model to boost the identification of fault-relevant variables via discriminating failed and passed test cases based on the variable values. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we have implemented it in a tool called VARDT and conducted an extensive study over the Defects4J benchmark. The results show that VARDT outperforms the state-of-the-art fault localization approaches with at least 247.8% improvements in terms of bugs located at Top-1, and the average improvements are 330.5%. Besides, to investigate whether our finer-grained fault localization result can further improve the effectiveness of downstream APR techniques, we have adapted VARDT to the application of patch filtering, where VARDT outperforms the state-of-the-art PATCH-SIM by filtering 26.0% more incorrect patches. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and it also provides a new way of thinking for improving automatic program repair techniques.

 - **Abstract**
 Biofouling is a major challenge for sustainable shipping, filter membranes, heat exchangers, and medical devices. The development of fouling-resistant coatings requires the evaluation of their effectiveness. Such an evaluation is usually based on the assessment of fouling progression after different exposure times to the target medium (e.g., salt water). The manual assessment of macrofouling requires expert knowledge about local fouling communities due to high variances in phenotypical appearance, has single-image sampling inaccuracies for certain species, and lacks spatial information. Here we present an approach for automatic image-based macrofouling analysis. We created a dataset with dense labels prepared from field panel images and propose a convolutional network (adapted U-Net) for the semantic segmentation of different macrofouling classes. The establishment of macrofouling localization allows for the generation of a successional model which enables the determination of direct surface attachment and in-depth epibiotic studies.

 - **Abstract**
 Knowledge graph embedding techniques are widely used for knowledge graph refinement tasks such as graph completion and triple classification. These techniques aim at embedding the entities and relations of a Knowledge Graph (KG) in a low dimensional continuous feature space. This paper adopts a transformer-based triplet network creating an embedding space that clusters the information about an entity or relation in the KG. It creates textual sequences from facts and fine-tunes a triplet network of pre-trained transformer-based language models. It adheres to an evaluation paradigm that relies on an efficient spatial semantic search technique. We show that this evaluation protocol is more adapted to a few-shot setting for the relation prediction task. Our proposed GilBERT method is evaluated on triplet classification and relation prediction tasks on multiple well-known benchmark knowledge graphs such as FB13, WN11, and FB15K. We show that GilBERT achieves better or comparable results to the state-of-the-art performance on these two refinement tasks.

 - **Abstract**
 Rapid global urbanization is a double-edged sword, heralding promises of economical prosperity and public health while also posing unique environmental and humanitarian challenges. Smart and connected communities (S&CCs) apply data-centric solutions to these problems by integrating artificial intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT). This coupling of intelligent technologies also poses interesting system design challenges regarding heterogeneous data fusion and task diversity. Transformers are of particular interest to address these problems, given their success across diverse fields of natural language processing (NLP), computer vision, time-series regression, and multi-modal data fusion. This begs the question whether Transformers can be further diversified to leverage fusions of IoT data sources for heterogeneous multi-task learning in S&CC trade spaces. In this paper, a Transformer-based AI system for emerging smart cities is proposed. Designed using a pure encoder backbone, and further customized through interchangeable input embedding and output task heads, the system supports virtually any input data and output task types present S&CCs. This generalizability is demonstrated through learning diverse task sets representative of S&CC environments, including multivariate time-series regression, visual plant disease classification, and image-time-series fusion tasks using a combination of Beijing PM2.5 and Plant Village datasets. Simulation results show that the proposed Transformer-based system can handle various input data types via custom sequence embedding techniques, and are naturally suited to learning a diverse set of tasks. The results also show that multi-task learners increase both memory and computational efficiency while maintaining comparable performance to both single-task variants, and non-Transformer baselines.

 - **Abstract**
 Vision Transformers (ViTs) have shown impressive performance but still require a high computation cost as compared to convolutional neural networks (CNNs), due to the global similarity measurements and thus a quadratic complexity with the input tokens. Existing efficient ViTs adopt local attention (e.g., Swin) or linear attention (e.g., Performer), which sacrifice ViTs' capabilities of capturing either global or local context. In this work, we ask an important research question: Can ViTs learn both global and local context while being more efficient during inference? To this end, we propose a framework called Castling-ViT, which trains ViTs using both linear-angular attention and masked softmax-based quadratic attention, but then switches to having only linear angular attention during ViT inference. Our Castling-ViT leverages angular kernels to measure the similarities between queries and keys via spectral angles. And we further simplify it with two techniques: (1) a novel linear-angular attention mechanism: we decompose the angular kernels into linear terms and high-order residuals, and only keep the linear terms; and (2) we adopt two parameterized modules to approximate high-order residuals: a depthwise convolution and an auxiliary masked softmax attention to help learn both global and local information, where the masks for softmax attention are regularized to gradually become zeros and thus incur no overhead during ViT inference. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on three tasks consistently validate the effectiveness of the proposed Castling-ViT, e.g., achieving up to a 1.8% higher accuracy or 40% MACs reduction on ImageNet classification and 1.2 higher mAP on COCO detection under comparable FLOPs, as compared to ViTs with vanilla softmax-based attentions.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper deals with the problem of localizing objects in image and video datasets from visual exemplars. In particular, we focus on the challenging problem of egocentric visual query localization. We first identify grave implicit biases in current query-conditioned model design and visual query datasets. Then, we directly tackle such biases at both frame and object set levels. Concretely, our method solves these issues by expanding limited annotations and dynamically dropping object proposals during training. Additionally, we propose a novel transformer-based module that allows for object-proposal set context to be considered while incorporating query information. We name our module Conditioned Contextual Transformer or CocoFormer. Our experiments show the proposed adaptations improve egocentric query detection, leading to a better visual query localization system in both 2D and 3D configurations. Thus, we are able to improve frame-level detection performance from 26.28% to 31.26 in AP, which correspondingly improves the VQ2D and VQ3D localization scores by significant margins. Our improved context-aware query object detector ranked first and second in the VQ2D and VQ3D tasks in the 2nd Ego4D challenge. In addition to this, we showcase the relevance of our proposed model in the Few-Shot Detection (FSD) task, where we also achieve SOTA results.

 - **Abstract**
 Scene text spotting is of great importance to the computer vision community due to its wide variety of applications. Recent methods attempt to introduce linguistic knowledge for challenging recognition rather than pure visual classification. However, how to effectively model the linguistic rules in end-to-end deep networks remains a research challenge. In this paper, we argue that the limited capacity of language models comes from 1) implicit language modeling; 2) unidirectional feature representation; and 3) language model with noise input. Correspondingly, we propose an autonomous, bidirectional and iterative ABINet++ for scene text spotting. Firstly, the autonomous suggests enforcing explicitly language modeling by decoupling the recognizer into vision model and language model and blocking gradient flow between both models. Secondly, a novel bidirectional cloze network (BCN) as the language model is proposed based on bidirectional feature representation. Thirdly, we propose an execution manner of iterative correction for the language model which can effectively alleviate the impact of noise input. Finally, to polish ABINet++ in long text recognition, we propose to aggregate horizontal features by embedding Transformer units inside a U-Net, and design a position and content attention module which integrates character order and content to attend to character features precisely. ABINet++ achieves state-of-the-art performance on both scene text recognition and scene text spotting benchmarks, which consistently demonstrates the superiority of our method in various environments especially on low-quality images. Besides, extensive experiments including in English and Chinese also prove that, a text spotter that incorporates our language modeling method can significantly improve its performance both in accuracy and speed compared with commonly used attention-based recognizers.

 - **Abstract**
 High-quality estimation of surface normal can help reduce ambiguity in many geometry understanding problems, such as collision avoidance and occlusion inference. This paper presents a technique for estimating the normal from 3D point clouds and 2D colour images. We have developed a transformer neural network that learns to utilise the hybrid information of visual semantic and 3D geometric data, as well as effective learning strategies. Compared to existing methods, the information fusion of the proposed method is more effective, which is supported by experiments. We have also built a simulation environment of outdoor traffic scenes in a 3D rendering engine to obtain annotated data to train the normal estimator. The model trained on synthetic data is tested on the real scenes in the KITTI dataset. And subsequent tasks built upon the estimated normal directions in the KITTI dataset show that the proposed estimator has advantage over existing methods.

 - **Abstract**
 Recently, deep learning approaches have been extensively studied for various problems in chemistry, such as virtual screening, de novo molecule design, etc. Despite the impressive successes, end-to-end training for specific tasks usually requires separately designed networks, so it's often difficult to acquire a unified principle to synergistically combine existing architectures and training datasets for novel tasks. To address this, inspired by recent advances of pre-trained multi-modal foundation models such as Vision-Language Pretrained models (VLP), here we present a novel multimodal foundation model that can be used {\em in silico} for various downstream tasks in chemistry. Specifically, our framework, dubbed as the structure-property multi-modal (SPMM) foundation model, is based on the dual-stream transformer with X-shape attention, so that it can align the molecule structure and the chemical properties in a common embedding space. Accordingly, SPMM can simultaneously perform chemical property prediction from given structure-describing strings and allows the generation of molecular structures for given chemical properties, which was previously not possible with a single architecture. Furthermore, we show that the outstanding unimodal representation of a molecule emerges from multimodal learning, which has the potential to be fine-tuned for many other downstream tasks.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper proposes an efficient multi-camera to Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) view transformation method for 3D perception, dubbed MatrixVT. Existing view transformers either suffer from poor transformation efficiency or rely on device-specific operators, hindering the broad application of BEV models. In contrast, our method generates BEV features efficiently with only convolutions and matrix multiplications (MatMul). Specifically, we propose describing the BEV feature as the MatMul of image feature and a sparse Feature Transporting Matrix (FTM). A Prime Extraction module is then introduced to compress the dimension of image features and reduce FTM's sparsity. Moreover, we propose the Ring \& Ray Decomposition to replace the FTM with two matrices and reformulate our pipeline to reduce calculation further. Compared to existing methods, MatrixVT enjoys a faster speed and less memory footprint while remaining deploy-friendly. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes benchmark demonstrate that our method is highly efficient but obtains results on par with the SOTA method in object detection and map segmentation tasks

 - **Abstract**
 Exploring sample relationships within each mini-batch has shown great potential for learning image representations. Existing works generally adopt the regular Transformer to model the visual content relationships, ignoring the cues of semantic/label correlations between samples. Also, they generally adopt the "full" self-attention mechanism which are obviously redundant and also sensitive to the noisy samples. To overcome these issues, in this paper, we design a simple yet flexible Batch-Graph Transformer (BGFormer) for mini-batch sample representations by deeply capturing the relationships of image samples from both visual and semantic perspectives. BGFormer has three main aspects. (1) It employs a flexible graph model, termed Batch Graph to jointly encode the visual and semantic relationships of samples within each mini-batch. (2) It explores the neighborhood relationships of samples by borrowing the idea of sparse graph representation which thus performs robustly, w.r.t., noisy samples. (3) It devises a novel Transformer architecture that mainly adopts dual structure-constrained self-attention (SSA), together with graph normalization, FFN, etc, to carefully exploit the batch graph information for sample tokens (nodes) representations. As an application, we apply BGFormer to the metric learning tasks. Extensive experiments on four popular datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model.

 - **Abstract**
 Dance is an important human art form, but creating new dances can be difficult and time-consuming. In this work, we introduce Editable Dance GEneration (EDGE), a state-of-the-art method for editable dance generation that is capable of creating realistic, physically-plausible dances while remaining faithful to the input music. EDGE uses a transformer-based diffusion model paired with Jukebox, a strong music feature extractor, and confers powerful editing capabilities well-suited to dance, including joint-wise conditioning, and in-betweening. We introduce a new metric for physical plausibility, and evaluate dance quality generated by our method extensively through (1) multiple quantitative metrics on physical plausibility, beat alignment, and diversity benchmarks, and more importantly, (2) a large-scale user study, demonstrating a significant improvement over previous state-of-the-art methods. Qualitative samples from our model can be found at our website.

 - **Abstract**
 Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have made great progress on both performance and efficiency over the last few years,but their unique working pattern makes it hard to train a high-performance low-latency SNN.Thus the development of SNNs still lags behind traditional artificial neural networks (ANNs).To compensate this gap,many extraordinary works have been proposed.Nevertheless,these works are mainly based on the same kind of network structure (i.e.CNN) and their performance is worse than their ANN counterparts,which limits the applications of SNNs.To this end,we propose a novel Transformer-based SNN,termed "Spikeformer",which outperforms its ANN counterpart on both static dataset and neuromorphic dataset and may be an alternative architecture to CNN for training high-performance SNNs.First,to deal with the problem of "data hungry" and the unstable training period exhibited in the vanilla model,we design the Convolutional Tokenizer (CT) module,which improves the accuracy of the original model on DVS-Gesture by more than 16%.Besides,in order to better incorporate the attention mechanism inside Transformer and the spatio-temporal information inherent to SNN,we adopt spatio-temporal attention (STA) instead of spatial-wise or temporal-wise attention.With our proposed method,we achieve competitive or state-of-the-art (SOTA) SNN performance on DVS-CIFAR10,DVS-Gesture,and ImageNet datasets with the least simulation time steps (i.e.low latency).Remarkably,our Spikeformer outperforms other SNNs on ImageNet by a large margin (i.e.more than 5%) and even outperforms its ANN counterpart by 3.1% and 2.2% on DVS-Gesture and ImageNet respectively,indicating that Spikeformer is a promising architecture for training large-scale SNNs and may be more suitable for SNNs compared to CNN.We believe that this work shall keep the development of SNNs in step with ANNs as much as possible.Code will be available.

 - **Abstract**
 We propose to use reinforcement learning to inform transformer-based contextualized link prediction models by providing paths that are most useful for predicting the correct answer. This is in contrast to previous approaches, that either used reinforcement learning (RL) to directly search for the answer, or based their prediction on limited or randomly selected context. Our experiments on WN18RR and FB15k-237 show that contextualized link prediction models consistently outperform RL-based answer search, and that additional improvements (of up to 13.5\% MRR) can be gained by combining RL with a link prediction model.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we introduce a set of effective TOken REduction (TORE) strategies for Transformer-based Human Mesh Recovery from monocular images. Current SOTA performance is achieved by Transformer-based structures. However, they suffer from high model complexity and computation cost caused by redundant tokens. We propose token reduction strategies based on two important aspects, i.e., the 3D geometry structure and 2D image feature, where we hierarchically recover the mesh geometry with priors from body structure and conduct token clustering to pass fewer but more discriminative image feature tokens to the Transformer. As a result, our method vastly reduces the number of tokens involved in high-complexity interactions in the Transformer, achieving competitive accuracy of shape recovery at a significantly reduced computational cost. We conduct extensive experiments across a wide range of benchmarks to validate the proposed method and further demonstrate the generalizability of our method on hand mesh recovery. Our code will be publicly available once the paper is published.

 - **Abstract**
 End-to-end text spotting aims to integrate scene text detection and recognition into a unified framework. Dealing with the relationship between the two sub-tasks plays a pivotal role in designing effective spotters. Although transformer-based methods eliminate the heuristic post-processing, they still suffer from the synergy issue between the sub-tasks and low training efficiency. In this paper, we present DeepSolo, a simple detection transformer baseline that lets a single Decoder with Explicit Points Solo for text detection and recognition simultaneously. Technically, for each text instance, we represent the character sequence as ordered points and model them with learnable explicit point queries. After passing a single decoder, the point queries have encoded requisite text semantics and locations and thus can be further decoded to the center line, boundary, script, and confidence of text via very simple prediction heads in parallel, solving the sub-tasks in text spotting in a unified framework. Besides, we also introduce a text-matching criterion to deliver more accurate supervisory signals, thus enabling more efficient training. Quantitative experiments on public benchmarks demonstrate that DeepSolo outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods and achieves better training efficiency. In addition, DeepSolo is also compatible with line annotations, which require much less annotation cost than polygons. The code will be released.

 - **Abstract**
 We present, NIO - Neural Interpolation Operator, a lightweight efficient neural operator-based architecture to perform video frame interpolation. Current deep learning based methods rely on local convolutions for feature learning and require a large amount of training on comprehensive datasets. Furthermore, transformer-based architectures are large and need dedicated GPUs for training. On the other hand, NIO, our neural operator-based approach learns the features in the frames by translating the image matrix into the Fourier space by using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). The model performs global convolution, making it discretization invariant. We show that NIO can produce visually-smooth and accurate results and converges in fewer epochs than state-of-the-art approaches. To evaluate the visual quality of our interpolated frames, we calculate the structural similarity index (SSIM) and Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) between the generated frame and the ground truth frame. We provide the quantitative performance of our model on Vimeo-90K dataset, DAVIS, UCF101 and DISFA+ dataset.

 - **Abstract**
 Vision transformers (ViTs) have recently obtained success in many applications, but their intensive computation and heavy memory usage at both training and inference time limit their generalization. Previous compression algorithms usually start from the pre-trained dense models and only focus on efficient inference, while time-consuming training is still unavoidable. In contrast, this paper points out that the million-scale training data is redundant, which is the fundamental reason for the tedious training. To address the issue, this paper aims to introduce sparsity into data and proposes an end-to-end efficient training framework from three sparse perspectives, dubbed Tri-Level E-ViT. Specifically, we leverage a hierarchical data redundancy reduction scheme, by exploring the sparsity under three levels: number of training examples in the dataset, number of patches (tokens) in each example, and number of connections between tokens that lie in attention weights. With extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed technique can noticeably accelerate training for various ViT architectures while maintaining accuracy. Remarkably, under certain ratios, we are able to improve the ViT accuracy rather than compromising it. For example, we can achieve 15.2% speedup with 72.6% (+0.4) Top-1 accuracy on Deit-T, and 15.7% speedup with 79.9% (+0.1) Top-1 accuracy on Deit-S. This proves the existence of data redundancy in ViT.

 - **Abstract**
 Recently, Dense Retrieval (DR) has become a promising solution to document retrieval, where document representations are used to perform effective and efficient semantic search. However, DR remains challenging on long documents, due to the quadratic complexity of its Transformer-based encoder and the finite capacity of a low-dimension embedding. Current DR models use suboptimal strategies such as truncating or splitting-and-pooling to long documents leading to poor utilization of whole document information. In this work, to tackle this problem, we propose Segment representation learning for long documents Dense Retrieval (SeDR). In SeDR, Segment-Interaction Transformer is proposed to encode long documents into document-aware and segment-sensitive representations, while it holds the complexity of splitting-and-pooling and outperforms other segment-interaction patterns on DR. Since GPU memory requirements for long document encoding causes insufficient negatives for DR training, Late-Cache Negative is further proposed to provide additional cache negatives for optimizing representation learning. Experiments on MS MARCO and TREC-DL datasets show that SeDR achieves superior performance among DR models, and confirm the effectiveness of SeDR on long document retrieval.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper presents solutions to the Machine Learning Model Attribution challenge (MLMAC) collectively organized by MITRE, Microsoft, Schmidt-Futures, Robust-Intelligence, Lincoln-Network, and Huggingface community. The challenge provides twelve open-sourced base versions of popular language models developed by well-known organizations and twelve fine-tuned language models for text generation. The names and architecture details of fine-tuned models were kept hidden, and participants can access these models only through the rest APIs developed by the organizers. Given these constraints, the goal of the contest is to identify which fine-tuned models originated from which base model. To solve this challenge, we have assumed that fine-tuned models and their corresponding base versions must share a similar vocabulary set with a matching syntactical writing style that resonates in their generated outputs. Our strategy is to develop a set of queries to interrogate base and fine-tuned models. And then perform one-to-many pairing between them based on similarities in their generated responses, where more than one fine-tuned model can pair with a base model but not vice-versa. We have employed four distinct approaches for measuring the resemblance between the responses generated from the models of both sets. The first approach uses evaluation metrics of the machine translation, and the second uses a vector space model. The third approach uses state-of-the-art multi-class text classification, Transformer models. Lastly, the fourth approach uses a set of Transformer based binary text classifiers, one for each provided base model, to perform multi-class text classification in a one-vs-all fashion. This paper reports implementation details, comparison, and experimental studies, of these approaches along with the final obtained results.

 - **Abstract**
 Recently, deep learning methods have shown promising results in point cloud compression. For octree-based point cloud compression, previous works show that the information of ancestor nodes and sibling nodes are equally important for predicting current node. However, those works either adopt insufficient context or bring intolerable decoding complexity (e.g. >600s). To address this problem, we propose a sufficient yet efficient context model and design an efficient deep learning codec for point clouds. Specifically, we first propose a window-constrained multi-group coding strategy to exploit the autoregressive context while maintaining decoding efficiency. Then, we propose a dual transformer architecture to utilize the dependency of current node on its ancestors and siblings. We also propose a random-masking pre-train method to enhance our model. Experimental results show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance for both lossy and lossless point cloud compression. Moreover, our multi-group coding strategy saves 98% decoding time compared with previous octree-based compression method.

 - **Abstract**
 Current 3D single object tracking methods are typically based on VoteNet, a 3D region proposal network. Despite the success, using a single seed point feature as the cue for offset learning in VoteNet prevents high-quality 3D proposals from being generated. Moreover, seed points with different importance are treated equally in the voting process, aggravating this defect. To address these issues, we propose a novel global-local transformer voting scheme to provide more informative cues and guide the model pay more attention on potential seed points, promoting the generation of high-quality 3D proposals. Technically, a global-local transformer (GLT) module is employed to integrate object- and patch-aware prior into seed point features to effectively form strong feature representation for geometric positions of the seed points, thus providing more robust and accurate cues for offset learning. Subsequently, a simple yet effective training strategy is designed to train the GLT module. We develop an importance prediction branch to learn the potential importance of the seed points and treat the output weights vector as a training constraint term. By incorporating the above components together, we exhibit a superior tracking method GLT-T. Extensive experiments on challenging KITTI and NuScenes benchmarks demonstrate that GLT-T achieves state-of-the-art performance in the 3D single object tracking task. Besides, further ablation studies show the advantages of the proposed global-local transformer voting scheme over the original VoteNet. Code and models will be available at https://github.com/haooozi/GLT-T.

 - **Abstract**
 Extracting class activation maps (CAM) is a key step for weakly-supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS). The CAM of convolution neural networks fails to capture long-range feature dependency on the image and result in the coverage on only foreground object parts, i.e., a lot of false negatives. An intuitive solution is ``coupling'' the CAM with the long-range attention matrix of visual transformers (ViT) We find that the direct ``coupling'', e.g., pixel-wise multiplication of attention and activation, achieves a more global coverage (on the foreground), but unfortunately goes with a great increase of false positives, i.e., background pixels are mistakenly included. This paper aims to tackle this issue. It proposes a new method to couple CAM and Attention matrix in a probabilistic Diffusion way, and dub it AD-CAM. Intuitively, it integrates ViT attention and CAM activation in a conservative and convincing way. Conservative is achieved by refining the attention between a pair of pixels based on their respective attentions to common neighbors, where the intuition is two pixels having very different neighborhoods are rarely dependent, i.e., their attention should be reduced. Convincing is achieved by diffusing a pixel's activation to its neighbors (on the CAM) in proportion to the corresponding attentions (on the AM). In experiments, our results on two challenging WSSS benchmarks PASCAL VOC and MS~COCO show that AD-CAM as pseudo labels can yield stronger WSSS models than the state-of-the-art variants of CAM.

 - **Abstract**
 Identifying the camera pose for a given image is a challenging problem with applications in robotics, autonomous vehicles, and augmented/virtual reality. Lately, learning-based methods have shown to be effective for absolute camera pose estimation. However, these methods are not accurate when generalizing to different domains. In this paper, a domain adaptive training framework for absolute pose regression is introduced. In the proposed framework, the scene image is augmented for different domains by using generative methods to train parallel branches using Barlow Twins objective. The parallel branches leverage a lightweight CNN-based absolute pose regressor architecture. Further, the efficacy of incorporating spatial and channel-wise attention in the regression head for rotation prediction is investigated. Our method is evaluated with two datasets, Cambridge landmarks and 7Scenes. The results demonstrate that, even with using roughly 24 times fewer FLOPs, 12 times fewer activations, and 5 times fewer parameters than MS-Transformer, our approach outperforms all the CNN-based architectures and achieves performance comparable to transformer-based architectures. Our method ranks 2nd and 4th with the Cambridge Landmarks and 7Scenes datasets, respectively. In addition, for augmented domains not encountered during training, our approach significantly outperforms the MS-transformer. Furthermore, it is shown that our domain adaptive framework achieves better performance than the single branch model trained with the identical CNN backbone with all instances of the unseen distribution.

 - **Abstract**
 Audio-visual speech enhancement aims to extract clean speech from a noisy environment by leveraging not only the audio itself but also the target speaker's lip movements. This approach has been shown to yield improvements over audio-only speech enhancement, particularly for the removal of interfering speech. Despite recent advances in speech synthesis, most audio-visual approaches continue to use spectral mapping/masking to reproduce the clean audio, often resulting in visual backbones added to existing speech enhancement architectures. In this work, we propose LA-VocE, a new two-stage approach that predicts mel-spectrograms from noisy audio-visual speech via a transformer-based architecture, and then converts them into waveform audio using a neural vocoder (HiFi-GAN). We train and evaluate our framework on thousands of speakers and 11+ different languages, and study our model's ability to adapt to different levels of background noise and speech interference. Our experiments show that LA-VocE outperforms existing methods according to multiple metrics, particularly under very noisy scenarios.

 - **Abstract**
 Combining the Color and Event cameras (also called Dynamic Vision Sensors, DVS) for robust object tracking is a newly emerging research topic in recent years. Existing color-event tracking framework usually contains multiple scattered modules which may lead to low efficiency and high computational complexity, including feature extraction, fusion, matching, interactive learning, etc. In this paper, we propose a single-stage backbone network for Color-Event Unified Tracking (CEUTrack), which achieves the above functions simultaneously. Given the event points and RGB frames, we first transform the points into voxels and crop the template and search regions for both modalities, respectively. Then, these regions are projected into tokens and parallelly fed into the unified Transformer backbone network. The output features will be fed into a tracking head for target object localization. Our proposed CEUTrack is simple, effective, and efficient, which achieves over 75 FPS and new SOTA performance. To better validate the effectiveness of our model and address the data deficiency of this task, we also propose a generic and large-scale benchmark dataset for color-event tracking, termed COESOT, which contains 90 categories and 1354 video sequences. Additionally, a new evaluation metric named BOC is proposed in our evaluation toolkit to evaluate the prominence with respect to the baseline methods. We hope the newly proposed method, dataset, and evaluation metric provide a better platform for color-event-based tracking. The dataset, toolkit, and source code will be released on: \url{https://github.com/Event-AHU/COESOT}.

 - **Abstract**
 Power transformers are an important component of a nuclear power plant (NPP). Currently, the NPP operates a lot of power transformers with extended service life, which exceeds the designated 25 years. Due to the extension of the service life, the task of monitoring the technical condition of power transformers becomes urgent. An important method for monitoring power transformers is Chromatographic Analysis of Dissolved Gas. It is based on the principle of controlling the concentration of gases dissolved in transformer oil. The appearance of almost any type of defect in equipment is accompanied by the formation of gases that dissolve in oil, and specific types of defects generate their gases in different quantities. At present, at NPPs, the monitoring systems for transformer equipment use predefined control limits for the concentration of dissolved gases in the oil. This study describes the stages of developing an algorithm to detect defects and faults in transformers automatically using machine learning and data analysis methods. Among machine learning models, we trained Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Neural Networks. The best of them were then combined into an ensemble (StackingClassifier) showing F1-score of 0.974 on a test sample. To develop mathematical models, we used data on the state of transformers, containing time series with values of gas concentrations (H2, CO, C2H4, C2H2). The datasets were labeled and contained four operating modes: normal mode, partial discharge, low energy discharge, low-temperature overheating.

 - **Abstract**
 Knowledge distillation (KD) has been a ubiquitous method for model compression to strengthen the capability of a lightweight model with the transferred knowledge from the teacher. In particular, KD has been employed in quantization-aware training (QAT) of Transformer encoders like BERT to improve the accuracy of the student model with the reduced-precision weight parameters. However, little is understood about which of the various KD approaches best fits the QAT of Transformers. In this work, we provide an in-depth analysis of the mechanism of KD on attention recovery of quantized large Transformers. In particular, we reveal that the previously adopted MSE loss on the attention score is insufficient for recovering the self-attention information. Therefore, we propose two KD methods; attention-map and attention-output losses. Furthermore, we explore the unification of both losses to address task-dependent preference between attention-map and output losses. The experimental results on various Transformer encoder models demonstrate that the proposed KD methods achieve state-of-the-art accuracy for QAT with sub-2-bit weight quantization.

 Previous works have demonstrated the importance of considering different modalities on molecules, each of which provide a varied granularity of information for downstream property prediction tasks. Our method combines variants of the recent TransformerM architecture with Transformer, GNN, and ResNet backbone architectures. Models are trained on the 2D data, 3D data, and image modalities of molecular graphs. We ensemble these models with a HuberRegressor. The models are trained on 4 different train/validation splits of the original train + valid datasets. This yields a winning solution to the 2\textsuperscript{nd} edition of the OGB Large-Scale Challenge (2022) on the PCQM4Mv2 molecular property prediction dataset. Our proposed method achieves a test-challenge MAE of $0.0723$ and a validation MAE of $0.07145$. Total inference time for our solution is less than 2 hours. We open-source our code at https://github.com/jfpuget/NVIDIA-PCQM4Mv2.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the fundamental mechanism behind the success of transformer networks is still an open problem in the deep learning literature. Although their remarkable performance has been mostly attributed to the self-attention mechanism, the literature still lacks a solid analysis of these networks and interpretation of the functions learned by them. To this end, we study the training problem of attention/transformer networks and introduce a novel convex analytic approach to improve the understanding and optimization of these networks. Particularly, we first introduce a convex alternative to the self-attention mechanism and reformulate the regularized training problem of transformer networks with our alternative convex attention. Then, we cast the reformulation as a convex optimization problem that is interpretable and easier to optimize. Moreover, as a byproduct of our convex analysis, we reveal an implicit regularization mechanism, which promotes sparsity across tokens. Therefore, we not only improve the optimization of attention/transformer networks but also provide a solid theoretical understanding of the functions learned by them. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of our theory through several numerical experiments.

 - **Abstract**
 With an unprecedented increase in the number of agents and systems that aim to navigate the real world using visual cues and the rising impetus for 3D Vision Models, the importance of depth estimation is hard to understate. While supervised methods remain the gold standard in the domain, the copious amount of paired stereo data required to train such models makes them impractical. Most State of the Art (SOTA) works in the self-supervised and unsupervised domain employ a ResNet-based encoder architecture to predict disparity maps from a given input image which are eventually used alongside a camera pose estimator to predict depth without direct supervision. The fully convolutional nature of ResNets makes them susceptible to capturing per-pixel local information only, which is suboptimal for depth prediction. Our key insight for doing away with this bottleneck is to use Vision Transformers, which employ self-attention to capture the global contextual information present in an input image. Our model fuses per-pixel local information learned using two fully convolutional depth encoders with global contextual information learned by a transformer encoder at different scales. It does so using a mask-guided multi-stream convolution in the feature space to achieve state-of-the-art performance on most standard benchmarks.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the generalization behavior of transfer learning of deep neural networks (DNNs). We adopt the overparameterization perspective -- featuring interpolation of the training data (i.e., approximately zero train error) and the double descent phenomenon -- to explain the delicate effect of the transfer learning setting on generalization performance. We study how the generalization behavior of transfer learning is affected by the dataset size in the source and target tasks, the number of transferred layers that are kept frozen in the target DNN training, and the similarity between the source and target tasks. We show that the test error evolution during the target DNN training has a more significant double descent effect when the target training dataset is sufficiently large with some label noise. In addition, a larger source training dataset can delay the arrival to interpolation and double descent peak in the target DNN training. Moreover, we demonstrate that the number of frozen layers can determine whether the transfer learning is effectively underparameterized or overparameterized and, in turn, this may affect the relative success or failure of learning. Specifically, we show that too many frozen layers may make a transfer from a less related source task better or on par with a transfer from a more related source task; we call this case overfreezing. We establish our results using image classification experiments with the residual network (ResNet) and vision transformer (ViT) architectures.

 - **Abstract**
 Large-scale Transformer models bring significant improvements for various downstream vision language tasks with a unified architecture. The performance improvements come with increasing model size, resulting in slow inference speed and increased cost for severing. While some certain predictions benefit from the full complexity of the large-scale model, not all of inputs need the same amount of computation to conduct, potentially leading to computation resource waste. To handle this challenge, early exiting is proposed to adaptively allocate computational power in term of input complexity to improve inference efficiency. The existing early exiting strategies usually adopt output confidence based on intermediate layers as a proxy of input complexity to incur the decision of skipping following layers. However, such strategies cannot apply to encoder in the widely-used unified architecture with both encoder and decoder due to difficulty of output confidence estimation in the encoder. It is suboptimal in term of saving computation power to ignore the early exiting in encoder component. To handle this challenge, we propose a novel early exiting strategy for unified visual language models, which allows dynamically skip the layers in encoder and decoder simultaneously in term of input layer-wise similarities with multiple times of early exiting, namely \textbf{MuE}. By decomposing the image and text modalities in the encoder, MuE is flexible and can skip different layers in term of modalities, advancing the inference efficiency while minimizing performance drop. Experiments on the SNLI-VE and MS COCO datasets show that the proposed approach MuE can reduce expected inference time by up to 50\% and 40\% while maintaining 99\% and 96\% performance respectively.
### Vision Transformer with Super Token Sampling

 - **Abstract**
 Vision transformer has achieved impressive performance for many vision tasks. However, it may suffer from high redundancy in capturing local features for shallow layers. Local self-attention or early-stage convolutions are thus utilized, which sacrifice the capacity to capture long-range dependency. A challenge then arises: can we access efficient and effective global context modeling at the early stages of a neural network? To address this issue, we draw inspiration from the design of superpixels, which reduces the number of image primitives in subsequent processing, and introduce super tokens into vision transformer. Super tokens attempt to provide a semantically meaningful tessellation of visual content, thus reducing the token number in self-attention as well as preserving global modeling. Specifically, we propose a simple yet strong super token attention (STA) mechanism with three steps: the first samples super tokens from visual tokens via sparse association learning, the second performs self-attention on super tokens, and the last maps them back to the original token space. STA decomposes vanilla global attention into multiplications of a sparse association map and a low-dimensional attention, leading to high efficiency in capturing global dependencies. Based on STA, we develop a hierarchical vision transformer. Extensive experiments demonstrate its strong performance on various vision tasks. In particular, without any extra training data or label, it achieves 86.4% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K with less than 100M parameters. It also achieves 53.9 box AP and 46.8 mask AP on the COCO detection task, and 51.9 mIOU on the ADE20K semantic segmentation task. Code will be released at https://github.com/hhb072/SViT.

 - **Abstract**
 Tremendous progress has been made in continual learning to maintain good performance on old tasks when learning new tasks by tackling the catastrophic forgetting problem of neural networks. This paper advances continual learning by further considering its out-of-distribution robustness, in response to the vulnerability of continually trained models to distribution shifts (e.g., due to data corruptions and domain shifts) in inference. To this end, we propose shape-texture debiased continual learning. The key idea is to learn generalizable and robust representations for each task with shape-texture debiased training. In order to transform standard continual learning to shape-texture debiased continual learning, we propose shape-texture debiased data generation and online shape-texture debiased self-distillation. Experiments on six datasets demonstrate the benefits of our approach in improving generalization and robustness, as well as reducing forgetting. Our analysis on the flatness of the loss landscape explains the advantages. Moreover, our approach can be easily combined with new advanced architectures such as vision transformer, and applied to more challenging scenarios such as exemplar-free continual learning.

 - **Abstract**
 Multivariate signals are prevalent in various domains, such as healthcare, transportation systems, and space sciences. Modeling spatiotemporal dependencies in multivariate signals is challenging due to (1) long-range temporal dependencies and (2) complex spatial correlations between sensors. To address these challenges, we propose representing multivariate signals as graphs and introduce GraphS4mer, a general graph neural network (GNN) architecture that captures both spatial and temporal dependencies in multivariate signals. Specifically, (1) we leverage Structured State Spaces model (S4), a state-of-the-art sequence model, to capture long-term temporal dependencies and (2) we propose a graph structure learning layer in GraphS4mer to learn dynamically evolving graph structures in the data. We evaluate our proposed model on three distinct tasks and show that GraphS4mer consistently improves over existing models, including (1) seizure detection from electroencephalography signals, outperforming a previous GNN with self-supervised pretraining by 3.1 points in AUROC; (2) sleep staging from polysomnography signals, a 4.1 points improvement in macro-F1 score compared to existing sleep staging models; and (3) traffic forecasting, reducing MAE by 8.8% compared to existing GNNs and by 1.4% compared to Transformer-based models.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper presents an end-to-end neural mapping method for camera localization, encoding a whole scene into a grid of latent codes, with which a Transformer-based auto-decoder regresses 3D coordinates of query pixels. State-of-the-art camera localization methods require each scene to be stored as a 3D point cloud with per-point features, which takes several gigabytes of storage per scene. While compression is possible, the performance drops significantly at high compression rates. NeuMap achieves extremely high compression rates with minimal performance drop by using 1) learnable latent codes to store scene information and 2) a scene-agnostic Transformer-based auto-decoder to infer coordinates for a query pixel. The scene-agnostic network design also learns robust matching priors by training with large-scale data, and further allows us to just optimize the codes quickly for a new scene while fixing the network weights. Extensive evaluations with five benchmarks show that NeuMap outperforms all the other coordinate regression methods significantly and reaches similar performance as the feature matching methods while having a much smaller scene representation size. For example, NeuMap achieves 39.1% accuracy in Aachen night benchmark with only 6MB of data, while other compelling methods require 100MB or a few gigabytes and fail completely under high compression settings. The codes are available at https://github.com/Tangshitao/NeuMap.

 - **Abstract**
 Limited by hardware cost and system size, camera's Field-of-View (FoV) is not always satisfactory. However, from a spatio-temporal perspective, information beyond the camera's physical FoV is off-the-shelf and can actually be obtained "for free" from the past. In this paper, we propose a novel task termed Beyond-FoV Estimation, aiming to exploit past visual cues and bidirectional break through the physical FoV of a camera. We put forward a FlowLens architecture to expand the FoV by achieving feature propagation explicitly by optical flow and implicitly by a novel clip-recurrent transformer, which has two appealing features: 1) FlowLens comprises a newly proposed Clip-Recurrent Hub with 3D-Decoupled Cross Attention (DDCA) to progressively process global information accumulated in the temporal dimension. 2) A multi-branch Mix Fusion Feed Forward Network (MixF3N) is integrated to enhance the spatially-precise flow of local features. To foster training and evaluation, we establish KITTI360-EX, a dataset for outer- and inner FoV expansion. Extensive experiments on both video inpainting and beyond-FoV estimation tasks show that FlowLens achieves state-of-the-art performance. Code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/MasterHow/FlowLens.

 - **Abstract**
 Capitalizing on the rapid development of neural networks, recent video frame interpolation (VFI) methods have achieved notable improvements. However, they still fall short for real-world videos containing large motions. Complex deformation and/or occlusion caused by large motions make it an extremely difficult problem in video frame interpolation. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective solution, H-VFI, to deal with large motions in video frame interpolation. H-VFI contributes a hierarchical video interpolation transformer (HVIT) to learn a deformable kernel in a coarse-to-fine strategy in multiple scales. The learnt deformable kernel is then utilized in convolving the input frames for predicting the interpolated frame. Starting from the smallest scale, H-VFI updates the deformable kernel by a residual in succession based on former predicted kernels, intermediate interpolated results and hierarchical features from transformer. Bias and masks to refine the final outputs are then predicted by a transformer block based on interpolated results. The advantage of such a progressive approximation is that the large motion frame interpolation problem can be decomposed into several relatively simpler sub-tasks, which enables a very accurate prediction in the final results. Another noteworthy contribution of our paper consists of a large-scale high-quality dataset, YouTube200K, which contains videos depicting a great variety of scenarios captured at high resolution and high frame rate. Extensive experiments on multiple frame interpolation benchmarks validate that H-VFI outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods especially for videos with large motions.

 - **Abstract**
 Vision transformers have achieved significant improvements on various vision tasks but their quadratic interactions between tokens significantly reduce computational efficiency. Many pruning methods have been proposed to remove redundant tokens for efficient vision transformers recently. However, existing studies mainly focus on the token importance to preserve local attentive tokens but completely ignore the global token diversity. In this paper, we emphasize the cruciality of diverse global semantics and propose an efficient token decoupling and merging method that can jointly consider the token importance and diversity for token pruning. According to the class token attention, we decouple the attentive and inattentive tokens. In addition to preserving the most discriminative local tokens, we merge similar inattentive tokens and match homogeneous attentive tokens to maximize the token diversity. Despite its simplicity, our method obtains a promising trade-off between model complexity and classification accuracy. On DeiT-S, our method reduces the FLOPs by 35% with only a 0.2% accuracy drop. Notably, benefiting from maintaining the token diversity, our method can even improve the accuracy of DeiT-T by 0.1% after reducing its FLOPs by 40%.

 - **Abstract**
 Existing deep calibrated photometric stereo networks basically aggregate observations under different lights based on the pre-defined operations such as linear projection and max pooling. While they are effective with the dense capture, simple first-order operations often fail to capture the high-order interactions among observations under small number of different lights. To tackle this issue, this paper presents a deep sparse calibrated photometric stereo network named {\it PS-Transformer} which leverages the learnable self-attention mechanism to properly capture the complex inter-image interactions. PS-Transformer builds upon the dual-branch design to explore both pixel-wise and image-wise features and individual feature is trained with the intermediate surface normal supervision to maximize geometric feasibility. A new synthetic dataset named CyclesPS+ is also presented with the comprehensive analysis to successfully train the photometric stereo networks. Extensive results on the publicly available benchmark datasets demonstrate that the surface normal prediction accuracy of the proposed method significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art algorithms with the same number of input images and is even comparable to that of dense algorithms which input 10$\times$ larger number of images.

 - **Abstract**
 Multi-modal skin lesion diagnosis (MSLD) has achieved remarkable success by modern computer-aided diagnosis technology based on deep convolutions. However, the information aggregation across modalities in MSLD remains challenging due to severity unaligned spatial resolution (dermoscopic image and clinical image) and heterogeneous data (dermoscopic image and patients' meta-data). Limited by the intrinsic local attention, most recent MSLD pipelines using pure convolutions struggle to capture representative features in shallow layers, thus the fusion across different modalities is usually done at the end of the pipelines, even at the last layer, leading to an insufficient information aggregation. To tackle the issue, we introduce a pure transformer-based method, which we refer to as ``Throughout Fusion Transformer (TFormer)", for sufficient information intergration in MSLD. Different from the existing approaches with convolutions, the proposed network leverages transformer as feature extraction backbone, bringing more representative shallow features. We then carefully design a stack of dual-branch hierarchical multi-modal transformer (HMT) blocks to fuse information across different image modalities in a stage-by-stage way. With the aggregated information of image modalities, a multi-modal transformer post-fusion (MTP) block is designed to integrate features across image and non-image data. Such a strategy that information of the image modalities is firstly fused then the heterogeneous ones enables us to better divide and conquer the two major challenges while ensuring inter-modality dynamics are effectively modeled. Experiments conducted on the public Derm7pt dataset validate the superiority of the proposed method. Our TFormer outperforms other state-of-the-art methods. Ablation experiments also suggest the effectiveness of our designs.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper studies the challenging problem of recovering motion from blur, also known as joint deblurring and interpolation or blur temporal super-resolution. The remaining challenges are twofold: 1) the current methods still leave considerable room for improvement in terms of visual quality even on the synthetic dataset, and 2) poor generalization to real-world data. To this end, we propose a blur interpolation transformer (BiT) to effectively unravel the underlying temporal correlation encoded in blur. Based on multi-scale residual Swin transformer blocks, we introduce dual-end temporal supervision and temporally symmetric ensembling strategies to generate effective features for time-varying motion rendering. In addition, we design a hybrid camera system to collect the first real-world dataset of one-to-many blur-sharp video pairs. Experimental results show that BiT has a significant gain over the state-of-the-art methods on the public dataset Adobe240. Besides, the proposed real-world dataset effectively helps the model generalize well to real blurry scenarios.
### N-Gram in Swin Transformers for Efficient Lightweight Image  Super-Resolution

 - **Abstract**
 While some studies have proven that Swin Transformer (SwinT) with window self-attention (WSA) is suitable for single image super-resolution (SR), SwinT ignores the broad regions for reconstructing high-resolution images due to window and shift size. In addition, many deep learning SR methods suffer from intensive computations. To address these problems, we introduce the N-Gram context to the image domain for the first time in history. We define N-Gram as neighboring local windows in SwinT, which differs from text analysis that views N-Gram as consecutive characters or words. N-Grams interact with each other by sliding-WSA, expanding the regions seen to restore degraded pixels. Using the N-Gram context, we propose NGswin, an efficient SR network with SCDP bottleneck taking all outputs of the hierarchical encoder. Experimental results show that NGswin achieves competitive performance while keeping an efficient structure, compared with previous leading methods. Moreover, we also improve other SwinT-based SR methods with the N-Gram context, thereby building an enhanced model: SwinIR-NG. Our improved SwinIR-NG outperforms the current best lightweight SR approaches and establishes state-of-the-art results. Codes will be available soon.

 - **Abstract**
 This work is intended as a voice in the discussion over the recent claims that LaMDA, a pretrained language model based on the Transformer model architecture, is sentient. This claim, if confirmed, would have serious ramifications in the Natural Language Processing (NLP) community due to wide-spread use of similar models. However, here we take the position that such a language model cannot be sentient, or conscious, and that LaMDA in particular exhibits no advances over other similar models that would qualify it. We justify this by analysing the Transformer architecture through Integrated Information Theory. We see the claims of consciousness as part of a wider tendency to use anthropomorphic language in NLP reporting. Regardless of the veracity of the claims, we consider this an opportune moment to take stock of progress in language modelling and consider the ethical implications of the task. In order to make this work helpful for readers outside the NLP community, we also present the necessary background in language modelling.

 - **Abstract**
 Image cropping has progressed tremendously under the data-driven paradigm. However, current approaches do not account for the intentions of the user, which is an issue especially when the composition of the input image is complex. Moreover, labeling of cropping data is costly and hence the amount of data is limited, leading to poor generalization performance of current algorithms in the wild. In this work, we take advantage of vision-language models as a foundation for creating robust and user-intentional cropping algorithms. By adapting a transformer decoder with a pre-trained CLIP-based detection model, OWL-ViT, we develop a method to perform cropping with a text or image query that reflects the user's intention as guidance. In addition, our pipeline design allows the model to learn text-conditioned aesthetic cropping with a small cropping dataset, while inheriting the open-vocabulary ability acquired from millions of text-image pairs. We validate our model through extensive experiments on existing datasets as well as a new cropping test set we compiled that is characterized by content ambiguity.
### Detect Only What You Specify : Object Detection with Linguistic Target

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.11572
 - **Abstract**
 Object detection is a computer vision task of predicting a set of bounding boxes and category labels for each object of interest in a given image. The category is related to a linguistic symbol such as 'dog' or 'person' and there should be relationships among them. However the object detector only learns to classify the categories and does not treat them as the linguistic symbols. Multi-modal models often use the pre-trained object detector to extract object features from the image, but the models are separated from the detector and the extracted visual features does not change with their linguistic input. We rethink the object detection as a vision-and-language reasoning task. We then propose targeted detection task, where detection targets are given by a natural language and the goal of the task is to detect only all the target objects in a given image. There are no detection if the target is not given. Commonly used modern object detectors have many hand-designed components like anchor and it is difficult to fuse the textual inputs into the complex pipeline. We thus propose Language-Targeted Detector (LTD) for the targeted detection based on a recently proposed Transformer-based detector. LTD is a encoder-decoder architecture and our conditional decoder allows the model to reason about the encoded image with the textual input as the linguistic context. We evaluate detection performances of LTD on COCO object detection dataset and also show that our model improves the detection results with the textual input grounding to the visual object.

 - **Abstract**
 Large-scale transformer models have become the de-facto architectures for various machine learning applications, e.g., CV and NLP. However, those large models also introduce prohibitive training costs. To mitigate this issue, we propose a novel random and layerwise token dropping method (random-LTD), which skips the computation of a subset of the input tokens at all middle layers. Particularly, random-LTD achieves considerable speedups and comparable accuracy as the standard training baseline. Compared to other token dropping methods, random-LTD does not require (1) any importance score-based metrics, (2) any special token treatment (e.g., [CLS]), and (3) many layers in full sequence length training except the first and the last layers. Besides, a new LayerToken learning rate schedule is proposed for pretraining problems that resolve the heavy tuning requirement for our proposed training mechanism. Finally, we demonstrate that random-LTD can be applied to broader applications, including GPT and BERT pretraining as well as ViT and GPT finetuning tasks. Our results show that random-LTD can save about 33.3% theoretical compute cost and 25.6% wall-clock training time while achieving similar zero-shot evaluations on GPT-31.3B as compared to baseline.
### Normalizing Flow with Variational Latent Representation

 - **Abstract**
 Normalizing flow (NF) has gained popularity over traditional maximum likelihood based methods due to its strong capability to model complex data distributions. However, the standard approach, which maps the observed data to a normal distribution, has difficulty in handling data distributions with multiple relatively isolated modes. To overcome this issue, we propose a new framework based on variational latent representation to improve the practical performance of NF. The idea is to replace the standard normal latent variable with a more general latent representation, jointly learned via Variational Bayes. For example, by taking the latent representation as a discrete sequence, our framework can learn a Transformer model that generates the latent sequence and an NF model that generates continuous data distribution conditioned on the sequence. The resulting method is significantly more powerful than the standard normalization flow approach for generating data distributions with multiple modes. Extensive experiments have shown the advantages of NF with variational latent representation.

 - **Abstract**
 Segmenting unseen objects is a critical task in many different domains. For example, a robot may need to grasp an unseen object, which means it needs to visually separate this object from the background and/or other objects. Mean shift clustering is a common method in object segmentation tasks. However, the traditional mean shift clustering algorithm is not easily integrated into an end-to-end neural network training pipeline. In this work, we propose the Mean Shift Mask Transformer (MSMFormer), a new transformer architecture that simulates the von Mises-Fisher (vMF) mean shift clustering algorithm, allowing for the joint training and inference of both the feature extractor and the clustering. Its central component is a hypersphere attention mechanism, which updates object queries on a hypersphere. To illustrate the effectiveness of our method, we apply MSMFormer to Unseen Object Instance Segmentation, which yields a new state-of-the-art of 87.3 Boundary F-meansure on the real-world Object Clutter Indoor Dataset (OCID).

 - **Abstract**
 Image registration is an essential but challenging task in medical image computing, especially for echocardiography, where the anatomical structures are relatively noisy compared to other imaging modalities. Traditional (non-learning) registration approaches rely on the iterative optimization of a similarity metric which is usually costly in time complexity. In recent years, convolutional neural network (CNN) based image registration methods have shown good effectiveness. In the meantime, recent studies show that the attention-based model (e.g., Transformer) can bring superior performance in pattern recognition tasks. In contrast, whether the superior performance of the Transformer comes from the long-winded architecture or is attributed to the use of patches for dividing the inputs is unclear yet. This work introduces three patch-based frameworks for image registration using MLPs and transformers. We provide experiments on 2D-echocardiography registration to answer the former question partially and provide a benchmark solution. Our results on a large public 2D echocardiography dataset show that the patch-based MLP/Transformer model can be effectively used for unsupervised echocardiography registration. They demonstrate comparable and even better registration performance than a popular CNN registration model. In particular, patch-based models better preserve volume changes in terms of Jacobian determinants, thus generating robust registration fields with less unrealistic deformation. Our results demonstrate that patch-based learning methods, whether with attention or not, can perform high-performance unsupervised registration tasks with adequate time and space complexity.

 - **Abstract**
 We present Perceiver-VL, a vision-and-language framework that efficiently handles high-dimensional multimodal inputs such as long videos and text. Powered by the iterative latent cross-attention of Perceiver, our framework scales with linear complexity, in contrast to the quadratic complexity of self-attention used in many state-of-the-art transformer-based models. To further improve the efficiency of our framework, we also study applying LayerDrop on cross-attention layers and introduce a mixed-stream architecture for cross-modal retrieval. We evaluate Perceiver-VL on diverse video-text and image-text benchmarks, where Perceiver-VL achieves the lowest GFLOPs and latency while maintaining competitive performance. In addition, we also provide comprehensive analyses of various aspects of our framework, including pretraining data, scalability of latent size and input size, dropping cross-attention layers at inference to reduce latency, modality aggregation strategy, positional encoding, and weight initialization strategy.

 - **Abstract**
 3D recognition is the foundation of 3D deep learning in many emerging fields, such as autonomous driving and robotics.Existing 3D methods mainly focus on the recognition of a fixed set of known classes and neglect possible unknown classes during testing. These unknown classes may cause serious accidents in safety-critical applications, i.e. autonomous driving. In this work, we make a first attempt to address 3D open-set recognition (OSR) so that a classifier can recognize known classes as well as be aware of unknown classes. We analyze open-set risks in the 3D domain and point out the overconfidence and under-representation problems that make existing methods perform poorly on the 3D OSR task. To resolve above problems, we propose a novel part prototype-based OSR method named PartCom. We use part prototypes to represent a 3D shape as a part composition, since a part composition can represent the overall structure of a shape and can help distinguish different known classes and unknown ones. Then we formulate two constraints on part prototypes to ensure their effectiveness. To reduce open-set risks further, we devise a PUFS module to synthesize unknown features as representatives of unknown samples by mixing up part composite features of different classes. We conduct experiments on three kinds of 3D OSR tasks based on both CAD shape dataset and scan shape dataset. Extensive experiments show that our method is powerful in classifying known classes and unknown ones and can attain much better results than SOTA baselines on all 3D OSR tasks. The project will be released.

 - **Abstract**
 There will be a long time when automated vehicles are mixed with human-driven vehicles. Understanding how drivers assess driving risks and modelling their individual differences are significant for automated vehicles to develop human-like and customized behaviors, so as to gain people's trust and acceptance. However, the reality is that existing driving risk models are developed at a statistical level, and no one scenario-universal driving risk measure can correctly describe risk perception differences among drivers. We proposed a concise yet effective model, called Potential Damage Risk (PODAR) model, which provides a universal and physically meaningful structure for driving risk estimation and is suitable for general non-collision and collision scenes. In this paper, based on an open-accessed dataset collected from an obstacle avoidance experiment, four physical-interpretable parameters in PODAR, including prediction horizon, damage scale, temporal attenuation, and spatial attention, are calibrated and consequently individual risk perception models are established for each driver. The results prove the capacity and potential of PODAR to model individual differences in perceived driving risk, laying the foundation for autonomous driving to develop human-like behaviors.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we investigate the two most popular families of deep neural architectures (i.e., ResNets and Inception nets) for the autonomous driving task of steering angle prediction. This work provides preliminary evidence that Inception architectures can perform as well or better than ResNet architectures with less complexity for the autonomous driving task. Primary motivation includes support for further research in smaller, more efficient neural network architectures such that can not only accomplish complex tasks, such as steering angle predictions, but also produce less carbon emissions, or, more succinctly, neural networks that are more environmentally friendly. We look at various sizes of ResNet and InceptionNet models to compare results. Our derived models can achieve state-of-the-art results in terms of steering angle MSE.

 - **Abstract**
 Multiple object detection and pose estimation are vital computer vision tasks. The latter relates to the former as a downstream problem in applications such as robotics and autonomous driving. However, due to the high complexity of both tasks, existing methods generally treat them independently, which is sub-optimal. We propose simultaneous neural modeling of both using monocular vision and 3D model infusion. Our Simultaneous Multiple Object detection and Pose Estimation network (SMOPE-Net) is an end-to-end trainable multitasking network with a composite loss that also provides the advantages of anchor-free detections for efficient downstream pose estimation. To enable the annotation of training data for our learning objective, we develop a Twin-Space object labeling method and demonstrate its correctness analytically and empirically. Using the labeling method, we provide the KITTI-6DoF dataset with $\sim7.5$K annotated frames. Extensive experiments on KITTI-6DoF and the popular LineMod datasets show a consistent performance gain with SMOPE-Net over existing pose estimation methods. Here are links to our proposed \href{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/SMOPE-Net-D3DF}{SMOPE-Net}, \href{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/LabelImg3D-6B16}{KITTI-6DoF dataset}, and \href{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/LabelImg3D-6B16}{LabelImg3D labeling tool}.

 - **Abstract**
 Pedestrian trajectory prediction task is an essential component of intelligent systems, and its applications include but are not limited to autonomous driving, robot navigation, and anomaly detection of monitoring systems. Due to the diversity of motion behaviors and the complex social interactions among pedestrians, accurately forecasting the future trajectory of pedestrians is challenging. Existing approaches commonly adopt GANs or CVAEs to generate diverse trajectories. However, GAN-based methods do not directly model data in a latent space, which makes them fail to have full support over the underlying data distribution; CVAE-based methods optimize a lower bound on the log-likelihood of observations, causing the learned distribution to deviate from the underlying distribution. The above limitations make existing approaches often generate highly biased or unnatural trajectories.In this paper, we propose a novel generative flow based framework with dual graphormer for pedestrian trajectory prediction (STGlow). Different from previous approaches, our method can more accurately model the underlying data distribution by optimizing the exact log-likelihood of motion behaviors. Besides, our method has clear physical meanings to simulate the evolution of human motion behaviors, where the forward process of the flow gradually degrades the complex motion behavior into a simple behavior, while its reverse process represents the evolution of a simple behavior to the complex motion behavior. Further, we introduce a dual graphormer combining with the graph structure to more adequately model the temporal dependencies and the mutual spatial interactions. Experimental results on several benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves much better performance compared to previous state-of-the-art approaches.

 Camera relocalization has various applications in autonomous driving. Previous camera pose regression models consider only ideal scenarios where there is little environmental perturbation. To deal with challenging driving environments that may have changing seasons, weather, illumination, and the presence of unstable objects, we propose RobustLoc, which derives its robustness against perturbations from neural differential equations. Our model uses a convolutional neural network to extract feature maps from multi-view images, a robust neural differential equation diffusion block module to diffuse information interactively, and a branched pose decoder with multi-layer training to estimate the vehicle poses. Experiments demonstrate that RobustLoc surpasses current state-of-the-art camera pose regression models and achieves robust performance in various environments.

 Instance segmentation is applied widely in image editing, image analysis and autonomous driving, etc. However, insufficient data is a common problem in practical applications. The Visual Inductive Priors(VIPriors) Instance Segmentation Challenge has focused on this problem. VIPriors for Data-Efficient Computer Vision Challenges ask competitors to train models from scratch in a data-deficient setting, but there are some visual inductive priors that can be used. In order to address the VIPriors instance segmentation problem, we designed a Task-Specific Data Augmentation(TS-DA) strategy and Inference Processing(TS-IP) strategy. The main purpose of task-specific data augmentation strategy is to tackle the data-deficient problem. And in order to make the most of visual inductive priors, we designed a task-specific inference processing strategy. We demonstrate the applicability of proposed method on VIPriors Instance Segmentation Challenge. The segmentation model applied is Hybrid Task Cascade based detector on the Swin-Base based CBNetV2 backbone. Experimental results demonstrate that proposed method can achieve a competitive result on the test set of 2022 VIPriors Instance Segmentation Challenge, with 0.531 AP@0.50:0.95.

 - **Abstract**
 Conditional imitation learning (CIL) trains deep neural networks, in an end-to-end manner, to mimic human driving. This approach has demonstrated suitable vehicle control when following roads, avoiding obstacles, or taking specific turns at intersections to reach a destination. Unfortunately, performance dramatically decreases when deployed to unseen environments and is inconsistent against varying weather conditions. Most importantly, the current CIL fails to avoid static road blockages. In this work, we propose a solution to those deficiencies. First, we fuse the laser scanner with the regular camera streams, at the features level, to overcome the generalization and consistency challenges. Second, we introduce a new efficient Occupancy Grid Mapping (OGM) method along with new algorithms for road blockages avoidance and global route planning. Consequently, our proposed method dynamically detects partial and full road blockages, and guides the controlled vehicle to another route to reach the destination. Following the original CIL work, we demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposal on CARLA simulator urban driving benchmark. Our experiments showed that our model improved consistency against weather conditions by four times and autonomous driving success rate generalization by 52%. Furthermore, our global route planner improved the driving success rate by 37%. Our proposed road blockages avoidance algorithm improved the driving success rate by 27%. Finally, the average kilometers traveled before a collision with a static object increased by 1.5 times.
