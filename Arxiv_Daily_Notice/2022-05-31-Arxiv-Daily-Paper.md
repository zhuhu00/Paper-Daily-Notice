 - **Abstract**
 A 2D and 3D building map provides invaluable information for understanding human activities and their impacts on Earth and its environment. Despite enormous efforts to improve the quality of building maps, current large-scale building maps have lots of errors and are limited to providing only 2D building information. This study presents a state-of-the-art 2D and 3D building extraction algorithm with airborne LiDAR data that is suitable for large-scale building mapping. Our algorithm operates in a fully unsupervised manner and does not require either any training label or training procedure. Our algorithm requires only simple operations of morphological filtering and planarity-based filtering but can produce an accurate 2D and 3D building map. A quantitative and qualitative evaluation in a large-scale dataset (-550 sqkm) of Denver and New York City showed that our algorithm outperforms the deep learning-based Microsoft's building mapping algorithm even without any parameter tuning. More extensive evaluations in different conditions of landscapes confirmed that our algorithm is scalable and can be improved further with appropriate parameter selection. Our algorithm is more advantageous than other image-based building extraction algorithms in that it is more computationally efficient, more accurate, and more explainable. Our proposed algorithm that can produce an accurate large-scale 2D and 3D building map provides a great potential towards a global-scale 2D and 3D building mapping with airborne LiDAR data.

 - **Abstract**
 There are two critical sensors for 3D perception in autonomous driving, the camera and the LiDAR. The camera provides rich semantic information such as color, texture, and the LiDAR reflects the 3D shape and locations of surrounding objects. People discover that fusing these two modalities can significantly boost the performance of 3D perception models as each modality has complementary information to the other. However, we observe that current datasets are captured from expensive vehicles that are explicitly designed for data collection purposes, and cannot truly reflect the realistic data distribution due to various reasons. To this end, we collect a series of real-world cases with noisy data distribution, and systematically formulate a robustness benchmark toolkit, that simulates these cases on any clean autonomous driving datasets. We showcase the effectiveness of our toolkit by establishing the robustness benchmark on two widely-adopted autonomous driving datasets, nuScenes and Waymo, then, to the best of our knowledge, holistically benchmark the state-of-the-art fusion methods for the first time. We observe that: i) most fusion methods, when solely developed on these data, tend to fail inevitably when there is a disruption to the LiDAR input; ii) the improvement of the camera input is significantly inferior to the LiDAR one. We further propose an efficient robust training strategy to improve the robustness of the current fusion method. The benchmark and code are available at https://github.com/kcyu2014/lidar-camera-robust-benchmark

 - **Abstract**
 Winter conditions, characterized by the presence of ice and snow on the ground, are more likely to lead to road accidents. This paper presents an experimental proof of concept of a collision avoidance algorithm for vehicles evolving in low adhesion conditions, implemented on a 1/5th scale car platform. In the proposed approach, a model-based estimator first processes the high-dimensional sensors data of the IMU, LIDAR and encoders to estimate physically relevant vehicle and ground conditions parameters such as the inertial velocity of the vehicle $v$, the friction coefficient $\mu$, the cohesion $c$ and the internal shear angle $\phi$. Then, a data-driven predictor is trained to predict the optimal maneuver to perform in the situation characterized by the estimated parameters. Experiments show that it is possible to 1) produce a real-time estimate of the relevant ground parameters, and 2) determine an optimal collision avoidance maneuver based on the estimated parameters.

 - **Abstract**
 Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) enable a wide series of technological advancements, ranging from clinical imaging, to predictive industrial maintenance and autonomous driving. However, recent findings indicate that transient hardware faults may corrupt the models prediction dramatically. For instance, the radiation-induced misprediction probability can be so high to impede a safe deployment of DNNs models at scale, urging the need for efficient and effective hardening solutions. In this work, we propose to tackle the reliability issue both at training and model design time. First, we show that vanilla models are highly affected by transient faults, that can induce a performances drop up to 37%. Hence, we provide three zero-overhead solutions, based on DNN re-design and re-train, that can improve DNNs reliability to transient faults up to one order of magnitude. We complement our work with extensive ablation studies to quantify the gain in performances of each hardening component.

 - **Abstract**
 Deep learning models have been deployed in numerous real-world applications such as autonomous driving and surveillance. However, these models are vulnerable in adversarial environments. Backdoor attack is emerging as a severe security threat which injects a backdoor trigger into a small portion of training data such that the trained model behaves normally on benign inputs but gives incorrect predictions when the specific trigger appears. While most research in backdoor attacks focuses on image classification, backdoor attacks on object detection have not been explored but are of equal importance. Object detection has been adopted as an important module in various security-sensitive applications such as autonomous driving. Therefore, backdoor attacks on object detection could pose severe threats to human lives and properties. We propose four kinds of backdoor attacks for object detection task: 1) Object Generation Attack: a trigger can falsely generate an object of the target class; 2) Regional Misclassification Attack: a trigger can change the prediction of a surrounding object to the target class; 3) Global Misclassification Attack: a single trigger can change the predictions of all objects in an image to the target class; and 4) Object Disappearance Attack: a trigger can make the detector fail to detect the object of the target class. We develop appropriate metrics to evaluate the four backdoor attacks on object detection. We perform experiments using two typical object detection models -- Faster-RCNN and YOLOv3 on different datasets. More crucially, we demonstrate that even fine-tuning on another benign dataset cannot remove the backdoor hidden in the object detection model. To defend against these backdoor attacks, we propose Detector Cleanse, an entropy-based run-time detection framework to identify poisoned testing samples for any deployed object detector.

 - **Abstract**
 The wide availability of data coupled with the computational advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning promise to enable many future technologies such as autonomous driving. While there has been a variety of successful demonstrations of these technologies, critical system failures have repeatedly been reported. Even if rare, such system failures pose a serious barrier to adoption without a rigorous risk assessment. This paper presents a framework for the systematic and rigorous risk verification of systems. We consider a wide range of system specifications formulated in signal temporal logic (STL) and model the system as a stochastic process, permitting discrete-time and continuous-time stochastic processes. We then define the STL robustness risk as the risk of lacking robustness against failure. This definition is motivated as system failures are often caused by missing robustness to modeling errors, system disturbances, and distribution shifts in the underlying data generating process. Within the definition, we permit general classes of risk measures and focus on tail risk measures such as the value-at-risk and the conditional value-at-risk. While the STL robustness risk is in general hard to compute, we propose the approximate STL robustness risk as a more tractable notion that upper bounds the STL robustness risk. We show how the approximate STL robustness risk can accurately be estimated from system trajectory data. For discrete-time stochastic processes, we show under which conditions the approximate STL robustness risk can even be computed exactly. We illustrate our verification algorithm in the autonomous driving simulator CARLA and show how a least risky controller can be selected among four neural network lane keeping controllers for five meaningful system specifications.

 - **Abstract**
 Driven by the ever-increasing requirements of autonomous vehicles, such as traffic monitoring and driving assistant, deep learning-based object detection (DL-OD) has been increasingly attractive in intelligent transportation systems. However, it is difficult for the existing DL-OD schemes to realize the responsible, cost-saving, and energy-efficient autonomous vehicle systems due to low their inherent defects of low timeliness and high energy consumption. In this paper, we propose an object detection (OD) system based on edge-cloud cooperation and reconstructive convolutional neural networks, which is called Edge YOLO. This system can effectively avoid the excessive dependence on computing power and uneven distribution of cloud computing resources. Specifically, it is a lightweight OD framework realized by combining pruning feature extraction network and compression feature fusion network to enhance the efficiency of multi-scale prediction to the largest extent. In addition, we developed an autonomous driving platform equipped with NVIDIA Jetson for system-level verification. We experimentally demonstrate the reliability and efficiency of Edge YOLO on COCO2017 and KITTI data sets, respectively. According to COCO2017 standard datasets with a speed of 26.6 frames per second (FPS), the results show that the number of parameters in the entire network is only 25.67 MB, while the accuracy (mAP) is up to 47.3%.

### Targeted Adaptive Design

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.14208
 - **Abstract**
 Modern advanced manufacturing and advanced materials design often require searches of relatively high-dimensional process control parameter spaces for settings that result in optimal structure, property, and performance parameters. The mapping from the former to the latter must be determined from noisy experiments or from expensive simulations. We abstract this problem to a mathematical framework in which an unknown function from a control space to a design space must be ascertained by means of expensive noisy measurements, which locate optimal control settings generating desired design features within specified tolerances, with quantified uncertainty. We describe targeted adaptive design (TAD), a new algorithm that performs this optimal sampling task. TAD creates a Gaussian process surrogate model of the unknown mapping at each iterative stage, proposing a new batch of control settings to sample experimentally and optimizing the updated log-predictive likelihood of the target design. TAD either stops upon locating a solution with uncertainties that fit inside the tolerance box or uses a measure of expected future information to determine that the search space has been exhausted with no solution. TAD thus embodies the exploration-exploitation tension in a manner that recalls, but is essentially different from, Bayesian optimization and optimal experimental design.
### Is it Worth to Reason about Uncertainty in Occupancy Grid Maps during  Path Planning?

 - **Subjects:** Robotics (cs.RO)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14251
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.14251
 - **Abstract**
 This paper investigates the usefulness of reasoning about the uncertain presence of obstacles during path planning, which typically stems from the usage of probabilistic occupancy grid maps for representing the environment when mapping via a noisy sensor like a stereo camera. The traditional planning paradigm prescribes using a hard threshold on the occupancy probability to declare that a cell is an obstacle, and to plan a single path accordingly while treating unknown space as free. We compare this approach against a new uncertainty-aware planner, which plans two different path hypotheses and then merges their initial trajectory segments into a single one ending in a "next-best view" pose. After this informative view is taken, the planner commits to one of the hypotheses, or to a completely new one if a collision is imminent. Simulations were conducted comparing the proposed and traditional planner. Results show the existence of planning scenarios -- like when the environment contains a dead-end, or when the goal is placed close to an obstacle -- in which reasoning about uncertainty can significantly decrease the robot's traveled distance and increase the chances of reaching the goal. The new planner was also validated on a real Clearpath Jackal robot equipped with a ZED 2 stereo camera.

 - **Abstract**
 In multi-robot missions, relative position and attitude information between agents is valuable for a variety of tasks such as mapping, planning, and formation control. In this paper, the problem of estimating relative poses from a set of inter-agent range measurements is investigated. Specifically, it is shown that the estimation accuracy is highly dependent on the true relative poses themselves, which prompts the desire to find multi-agent formations that provide the best estimation performance. By direct maximization of Fischer information, it is shown in simulation and experiment that large improvements in estimation accuracy can be obtained by optimizing the formation geometry of a team of robots.

 - **Abstract**
 Neural radiance fields have made a remarkable breakthrough in the novel view synthesis task at the 3D static scene. However, for the 4D circumstance (e.g., dynamic scene), the performance of the existing method is still limited by the capacity of the neural network, typically in a multilayer perceptron network (MLP). In this paper, we present the method to model the 4D neural radiance field by the 3D voxel, short as V4D, where the 3D voxel has two formats. The first one is to regularly model the bounded 3D space and then use the sampled local 3D feature with the time index to model the density field and the texture field. The second one is in look-up tables (LUTs) format that is for the pixel-level refinement, where the pseudo-surface produced by the volume rendering is utilized as the guidance information to learn a 2D pixel-level refinement mapping. The proposed LUTs-based refinement module achieves the performance gain with a little computational cost and could serve as the plug-and-play module in the novel view synthesis task. Moreover, we propose a more effective conditional positional encoding toward the 4D data that achieves performance gain with negligible computational burdens. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance by a large margin. At last, the proposed V4D is also a computational-friendly method in both the training and testing phase, where we achieve 2 times faster in the training phase and 10 times faster in the inference phase compared with the state-of-the-art method.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.14414
 - **Abstract**
 The stretch energy is a fully nonlinear energy functional that has been applied to the numerical computation of area-preserving mappings. However, this approach lacks theoretical support and the analysis is complicated due to the full nonlinearity of the functional. In this paper, we provide a theoretical foundation of the stretch energy minimization for the computation of area-preserving mappings, including a neat formulation of the gradient of the functional, and the proof of the minimizers of the functional being area-preserving mappings. In addition, the geometric interpretation of the stretch energy is also provided to better understand this energy functional. Furthermore, numerical experiments are demonstrated to validate the effectiveness and accuracy of the stretch energy minimization for the computation of square-shaped area-preserving mappings of simplicial surfaces.
### Angle-Uniform Parallel Coordinates

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14430
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.14430
 - **Abstract**
 We present angle-uniform parallel coordinates, a data-independent technique that deforms the image plane of parallel coordinates so that the angles of linear relationships between two variables are linearly mapped along the horizontal axis of the parallel coordinates plot. Despite being a common method for visualizing multidimensional data, parallel coordinates are ineffective for revealing positive correlations since the associated parallel coordinates points of such structures may be located at infinity in the image plane and the asymmetric encoding of negative and positive correlations may lead to unreliable estimations. To address this issue, we introduce a transformation that bounds all points horizontally using an angle-uniform mapping and shrinks them vertically in a structure-preserving fashion; polygonal lines become smooth curves and symmetric representation of data correlations is achieved. We further propose a combined subsampling and density visualization approach to reduce visual clutter caused by overdrawing. Our method enables accurate visual pattern interpretation of data correlations, and its data-independent nature makes it applicable to all multidimensional datasets. The usefulness of our method is demonstrated using examples of synthetic and real-world datasets.

 - **Abstract**
 The increasing prevalence and growing size of data in modern applications have led to high costs for computation in traditional processor-centric computing systems. Moving large volumes of data between memory devices (e.g., DRAM) and computing elements (e.g., CPUs, GPUs) across bandwidth-limited memory channels can consume more than 60% of the total energy in modern systems. To mitigate these costs, the processing-in-memory (PIM) paradigm moves computation closer to where the data resides, reducing (and in some cases eliminating) the need to move data between memory and the processor. There are two main approaches to PIM: (1) processing-near-memory (PnM), where PIM logic is added to the same die as memory or to the logic layer of 3D-stacked memory; and (2) processing-using-memory (PuM), which uses the operational principles of memory cells to perform computation. Many works from academia and industry have shown the benefits of PnM and PuM for a wide range of workloads from different domains. However, fully adopting PIM in commercial systems is still very challenging due to the lack of tools and system support for PIM architectures across the computer architecture stack, which includes: (i) workload characterization methodologies and benchmark suites targeting PIM architectures; (ii) frameworks that can facilitate the implementation of complex operations and algorithms using the underlying PIM primitives; (iii) compiler support and compiler optimizations targeting PIM architectures; (iv) operating system support for PIM-aware virtual memory, memory management, data allocation, and data mapping; and (v) efficient data coherence and consistency mechanisms. Our goal in this work is to provide tools and system support for PnM and PuM architectures, aiming to ease the adoption of PIM in current and future systems.
### Glance to Count: Learning to Rank with Anchors for Weakly-supervised  Crowd Counting

 - **Abstract**
 Crowd image is arguably one of the most laborious data to annotate. In this paper, we devote to reduce the massive demand of densely labeled crowd data, and propose a novel weakly-supervised setting, in which we leverage the binary ranking of two images with high-contrast crowd counts as training guidance. To enable training under this new setting, we convert the crowd count regression problem to a ranking potential prediction problem. In particular, we tailor a Siamese Ranking Network that predicts the potential scores of two images indicating the ordering of the counts. Hence, the ultimate goal is to assign appropriate potentials for all the crowd images to ensure their orderings obey the ranking labels. On the other hand, potentials reveal the relative crowd sizes but cannot yield an exact crowd count. We resolve this problem by introducing "anchors" during the inference stage. Concretely, anchors are a few images with count labels used for referencing the corresponding counts from potential scores by a simple linear mapping function. We conduct extensive experiments to study various combinations of supervision, and we show that the proposed method outperforms existing weakly-supervised methods without additional labeling effort by a large margin.
### Universality of group convolutional neural networks based on ridgelet  analysis on groups

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14819
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.14819
 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the approximation property of group convolutional neural networks (GCNNs) based on the ridgelet theory. We regard a group convolution as a matrix element of a group representation, and formulate a versatile GCNN as a nonlinear mapping between group representations, which covers typical GCNN literatures such as a cyclic convolution on a multi-channel image, permutation-invariant datasets (Deep Sets), and $\mathrm{E}(n)$-equivariant convolutions. The ridgelet transform is an analysis operator of a depth-2 network, namely, it maps an arbitrary given target function $f$ to the weight $\gamma$ of a network $S[\gamma]$ so that the network represents the function as $S[\gamma]=f$. It has been known only for fully-connected networks, and this study is the first to present the ridgelet transform for (G)CNNs. Since the ridgelet transform is given as a closed-form integral operator, it provides a constructive proof of the $cc$-universality of GCNNs. Unlike previous universality arguments on CNNs, we do not need to convert/modify the networks into other universal approximators such as invariant polynomials and fully-connected networks.

 - **Abstract**
 Terrain mapping is not only dedicated to communicating how high or how steep a landscape is but can also help to narrate how we feel about a place. However, crafting effective and expressive hypsometric tints is challenging for both nonexperts and experts. In this paper, we present a two-step image-to-terrain color transfer method that can transfer color from arbitrary images to diverse terrain models. First, we present a new image color organization method that organizes discrete, irregular image colors into a continuous, regular color grid that facilitates a series of color operations, such as local and global searching, categorical color selection and sequential color interpolation. Second, we quantify a series of subjective concerns about elevation color crafting, such as "the lower, the higher" principle, color conventions, and aerial perspectives. We also define color similarity between image and terrain visualization with aesthetic quality. We then mathematically formulate image-to-terrain color transfer as a dual-objective optimization problem and offer a heuristic searching method to solve the problem. Finally, we compare elevation tints from our method with a standard color scheme on four test terrains. The evaluations show that the hypsometric tints from the proposed method can work as effectively as the standard scheme and that our tints are more visually favorable. We also showcase that our method can transfer emotion from image to terrain visualization.

 - **Abstract**
 The performance of GNNs degrades as they become deeper due to the over-smoothing. Among all the attempts to prevent over-smoothing, residual connection is one of the promising methods due to its simplicity. However, recent studies have shown that GNNs with residual connections only slightly slow down the degeneration. The reason why residual connections fail in GNNs is still unknown. In this paper, we investigate the forward and backward behavior of GNNs with residual connections from a novel path decomposition perspective. We find that the recursive aggregation of the median length paths from the binomial distribution of residual connection paths dominates output representation, resulting in over-smoothing as GNNs go deeper. Entangled propagation and weight matrices cause gradient smoothing and prevent GNNs with residual connections from optimizing to the identity mapping. Based on these findings, we present a Universal Deep GNNs (UDGNN) framework with cold-start adaptive residual connections (DRIVE) and feedforward modules. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, which achieves state-of-the-art results over non-smooth heterophily datasets by simply stacking standard GNNs.

 - **Abstract**
 In the paper, a variant of the \ssstar Newton method is developed for the numerical solution of generalized equations, in which the multi-valued part is a so-called SCD (subspace containing derivative) mapping. Under a rather mild regularity requirement, the method exhibits (locally) superlinear convergence behavior. From the main conceptual algorithm, two implementable variants are derived whose efficiency is tested via a generalized equation modeling a discretized static contact problem with Coulomb friction.

 Sampling techniques, such as t-wise interaction sampling are used to enable efficient testing for configurable systems. This is achieved by generating a small yet representative sample of configurations for a system, which circumvents testing the entire solution space. However, by design, most recent approaches for t-wise interaction sampling only consider combinations of configuration options from a configurable system's variability model and do not take into account their mapping onto the solution space, thus potentially leaving critical implementation artifacts untested. Tartler et al. address this problem by considering presence conditions of implementation artifacts rather than pure configuration options, but do not consider the possible interactions between these artifacts. In this paper, we introduce t-wise presence condition coverage, which extends the approach of Tartler et al. by using presence conditions extracted from the code as basis to cover t-wise interactions. This ensures that all t-wise interactions of implementation artifacts are included in the sample and that the chance of detecting combinations of faulty configuration options is increased. We evaluate our approach in terms of testing efficiency and testing effectiveness by comparing the approach to existing t-wise interaction sampling techniques. We show that t-wise presence condition sampling is able to produce mostly smaller samples compared to t-wise interaction sampling, while guaranteeing a t-wise presence condition coverage of 100%.

 - **Abstract**
 Several techniques have been proposed over the years for automatic hypocenter localization. While those techniques have pros and cons that trade-off computational efficiency and the susceptibility of getting trapped in local minima, an alternate approach is needed that allows robust localization performance and holds the potential to make the elusive goal of real-time microseismic monitoring possible. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have appeared on the scene as a flexible and versatile framework for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) along with the associated initial or boundary conditions. We develop HypoPINN -- a PINN-based inversion framework for hypocenter localization and introduce an approximate Bayesian framework for estimating its predictive uncertainties. This work focuses on predicting the hypocenter locations using HypoPINN and investigates the propagation of uncertainties from the random realizations of HypoPINN's weights and biases using the Laplace approximation. We train HypoPINN to obtain the optimized weights for predicting hypocenter location. Next, we approximate the covariance matrix at the optimized HypoPINN's weights for posterior sampling with the Laplace approximation. The posterior samples represent various realizations of HypoPINN's weights. Finally, we predict the locations of the hypocenter associated with those weights' realizations to investigate the uncertainty propagation that comes from those realisations. We demonstrate the features of this methodology through several numerical examples, including using the Otway velocity model based on the Otway project in Australia.

 - **Abstract**
 Distilling from the feature maps can be fairly effective for dense prediction tasks since both the feature discriminability and localization priors can be well transferred. However, not every pixel contributes equally to the performance, and a good student should learn from what really matters to the teacher. In this paper, we introduce a learnable embedding dubbed receptive token to localize those pixels of interests (PoIs) in the feature map, with a distillation mask generated via pixel-wise attention. Then the distillation will be performed on the mask via pixel-wise reconstruction. In this way, a distillation mask actually indicates a pattern of pixel dependencies within feature maps of teacher. We thus adopt multiple receptive tokens to investigate more sophisticated and informative pixel dependencies to further enhance the distillation. To obtain a group of masks, the receptive tokens are learned via the regular task loss but with teacher fixed, and we also leverage a Dice loss to enrich the diversity of learned masks. Our method dubbed MasKD is simple and practical, and needs no priors of tasks in application. Experiments show that our MasKD can achieve state-of-the-art performance consistently on object detection and semantic segmentation benchmarks. Code is available at: https://github.com/hunto/MasKD .

 Unsupervised anomaly detection and localization, as of one the most practical and challenging problems in computer vision, has received great attention in recent years. From the time the MVTec AD dataset was proposed to the present, new research methods that are constantly being proposed push its precision to saturation. It is the time to conduct a comprehensive comparison of existing methods to inspire further research. This paper extensively compares 13 papers in terms of the performance in unsupervised anomaly detection and localization tasks, and adds a comparison of inference efficiency previously ignored by the community. Meanwhile, analysis of the MVTec AD dataset are also given, especially the label ambiguity that affects the model fails to achieve full marks. Moreover, considering the proposal of the new MVTec 3D-AD dataset, this paper also conducts experiments using the existing state-of-the-art 2D methods on this new dataset, and reports the corresponding results with analysis.

 - **Abstract**
 The problem of optimization on Stiefel manifold, i.e., minimizing functions of (not necessarily square) matrices that satisfy orthogonality constraints, has been extensively studied, partly due to rich machine learning applications. Yet, a new approach is proposed based on, for the first time, an interplay between thoughtfully designed continuous and discrete dynamics. It leads to a gradient-based optimizer with intrinsically added momentum. This method exactly preserves the manifold structure but does not require commonly used projection or retraction, and thus having low computational costs when compared to existing algorithms. Its generalization to adaptive learning rates is also demonstrated. Pleasant performances are observed in various practical tasks. For instance, we discover that placing orthogonal constraints on attention heads of trained-from-scratch Vision Transformer [Dosovitskiy et al. 2022] could remarkably improve its performance, when our optimizer is used, and it is better that each head is made orthogonal within itself but not necessarily to other heads. This optimizer also makes the useful notion of Projection Robust Wasserstein Distance [Paty & Cuturi 2019][Lin et al. 2020] for high-dim. optimal transport even more effective.

 - **Abstract**
 Recently, Transformers were shown to enhance the performance of multi-view stereo by enabling long-range feature interaction. In this work, we propose Window-based Transformers (WT) for local feature matching and global feature aggregation in multi-view stereo. We introduce a Window-based Epipolar Transformer (WET) which reduces matching redundancy by using epipolar constraints. Since point-to-line matching is sensitive to erroneous camera pose and calibration, we match windows near the epipolar lines. A second Shifted WT is employed for aggregating global information within cost volume. We present a novel Cost Transformer (CT) to replace 3D convolutions for cost volume regularization. In order to better constrain the estimated depth maps from multiple views, we further design a novel geometric consistency loss (Geo Loss) which punishes unreliable areas where multi-view consistency is not satisfied. Our WT multi-view stereo method (WT-MVSNet) achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple datasets and ranks $1^{st}$ on Tanks and Temples benchmark.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we present a learning-based approach for multi-view stereo (MVS), i.e., estimate the depth map of a reference frame using posed multi-view images. Our core idea lies in leveraging a "learning-to-optimize" paradigm to iteratively index a plane-sweeping cost volume and regress the depth map via a convolutional Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). Since the cost volume plays a paramount role in encoding the multi-view geometry, we aim to improve its construction both in pixel- and frame- levels. In the pixel level, we propose to break the symmetry of the Siamese network (which is typically used in MVS to extract image features) by introducing a transformer block to the reference image (but not to the source images). Such an asymmetric volume allows the network to extract global features from the reference image to predict its depth map. In view of the inaccuracy of poses between reference and source images, we propose to incorporate a residual pose network to make corrections to the relative poses, which essentially rectifies the cost volume in the frame-level. We conduct extensive experiments on real-world MVS datasets and show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of both within-dataset evaluation and cross-dataset generalization.
### Gating Dropout: Communication-efficient Regularization for Sparsely  Activated Transformers

 - **Abstract**
 Sparsely activated transformers, such as Mixture of Experts (MoE), have received great interest due to their outrageous scaling capability which enables dramatical increases in model size without significant increases in computational cost. To achieve this, MoE models replace the feedforward sub-layer with Mixture-of-Experts sub-layer in transformers and use a gating network to route each token to its assigned experts. Since the common practice for efficient training of such models requires distributing experts and tokens across different machines, this routing strategy often incurs huge cross-machine communication cost because tokens and their assigned experts likely reside in different machines. In this paper, we propose \emph{Gating Dropout}, which allows tokens to ignore the gating network and stay at their local machines, thus reducing the cross-machine communication. Similar to traditional dropout, we also show that Gating Dropout has a regularization effect during training, resulting in improved generalization performance. We validate the effectiveness of Gating Dropout on multilingual machine translation tasks. Our results demonstrate that Gating Dropout improves a state-of-the-art MoE model with faster wall-clock time convergence rates and better BLEU scores for a variety of model sizes and datasets.

 - **Abstract**
 Self-supervised pre-training for images without labels has recently achieved promising performance in image classification. The success of transformer-based methods, ViT and MAE, draws the community's attention to the design of backbone architecture and self-supervised task. In this work, we show that current masked image encoding models learn the underlying relationship between all objects in the whole scene, instead of a single object representation. Therefore, those methods bring a lot of compute time for self-supervised pre-training. To solve this issue, we introduce a novel object selection and division strategy to drop non-object patches for learning object-wise representations by selective reconstruction with interested region masks. We refer to this method ObjMAE. Extensive experiments on four commonly-used datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in reducing the compute cost by 72% while achieving competitive performance. Furthermore, we investigate the inter-object and intra-object relationship and find that the latter is crucial for self-supervised pre-training.

 - **Abstract**
 Previous multi-task dense prediction studies developed complex pipelines such as multi-modal distillations in multiple stages or searching for task relational contexts for each task. The core insight beyond these methods is to maximize the mutual effects between each task. Inspired by the recent query-based Transformers, we propose a simpler pipeline named Multi-Query Transformer (MQTransformer) that is equipped with multiple queries from different tasks to facilitate the reasoning among multiple tasks and simplify the cross task pipeline. Instead of modeling the dense per-pixel context among different tasks, we seek a task-specific proxy to perform cross-task reasoning via multiple queries where each query encodes the task-related context. The MQTransformer is composed of three key components: shared encoder, cross task attention and shared decoder. We first model each task with a task-relevant and scale-aware query, and then both the image feature output by the feature extractor and the task-relevant query feature are fed into the shared encoder, thus encoding the query feature from the image feature. Secondly, we design a cross task attention module to reason the dependencies among multiple tasks and feature scales from two perspectives including different tasks of the same scale and different scales of the same task. Then we use a shared decoder to gradually refine the image features with the reasoned query features from different tasks. Extensive experiment results on two dense prediction datasets (NYUD-v2 and PASCAL-Context) show that the proposed method is an effective approach and achieves the state-of-the-art result. Code will be available.

 - **Abstract**
 Gains in the ability to generalize on image analysis tasks for neural networks have come at the cost of increased number of parameters and layers, dataset sizes, training and test computations, and GPU RAM. We introduce a new architecture -- WaveMix-Lite -- that can generalize on par with contemporary transformers and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) while needing fewer resources. WaveMix-Lite uses 2D-discrete wavelet transform to efficiently mix spatial information from pixels. WaveMix-Lite seems to be a versatile and scalable architectural framework that can be used for multiple vision tasks, such as image classification and semantic segmentation, without requiring significant architectural changes, unlike transformers and CNNs. It is able to meet or exceed several accuracy benchmarks while training on a single GPU. For instance, it achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on five EMNIST datasets, outperforms CNNs and transformers in ImageNet-1K (64$\times$64 images), and achieves an mIoU of 75.32 % on Cityscapes validation set, while using less than one-fifth the number parameters and half the GPU RAM of comparable CNNs or transformers. Our experiments show that while the convolutional elements of neural architectures exploit the shift-invariance property of images, new types of layers (e.g., wavelet transform) can exploit additional properties of images, such as scale-invariance and finite spatial extents of objects.

 - **Abstract**
 Masked Autoencoders (MAE) have shown great potentials in self-supervised pre-training for language and 2D image transformers. However, it still remains an open question on how to exploit masked autoencoding for learning 3D representations of irregular point clouds. In this paper, we propose Point-M2AE, a strong Multi-scale MAE pre-training framework for hierarchical self-supervised learning of 3D point clouds. Unlike the standard transformer in MAE, we modify the encoder and decoder into pyramid architectures to progressively model spatial geometries and capture both fine-grained and high-level semantics of 3D shapes. For the encoder that downsamples point tokens by stages, we design a multi-scale masking strategy to generate consistent visible regions across scales, and adopt a local spatial self-attention mechanism to focus on neighboring patterns. By multi-scale token propagation, the lightweight decoder gradually upsamples point tokens with complementary skip connections from the encoder, which further promotes the reconstruction from a global-to-local perspective. Extensive experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of Point-M2AE for 3D representation learning. With a frozen encoder after pre-training, Point-M2AE achieves 92.9% accuracy for linear SVM on ModelNet40, even surpassing some fully trained methods. By fine-tuning on downstream tasks, Point-M2AE achieves 86.43% accuracy on ScanObjectNN, +3.36% to the second-best, and largely benefits the few-shot classification, part segmentation and 3D object detection with the hierarchical pre-training scheme.

### Non-stationary Transformers: Rethinking the Stationarity in Time Series  Forecasting

 - **Abstract**
 Transformers have shown great power in time series forecasting due to their global-range modeling ability. However, their performance can degenerate terribly on non-stationary real-world data in which the joint distribution changes over time. Previous studies primarily adopt stationarization to reduce the non-stationarity of original series for better predictability. But the stationarized series deprived of inherent non-stationarity can be less instructive for real-world bursty events forecasting. This problem, termed over-stationarization in this paper, leads Transformers to generate indistinguishable temporal attentions for different series and impedes the predictive capability of deep models. To tackle the dilemma between series predictability and model capability, we propose Non-stationary Transformers as a generic framework with two interdependent modules: Series Stationarization and De-stationary Attention. Concretely, Series Stationarization unifies the statistics of each input and converts the output with restored statistics for better predictability. To address over-stationarization, De-stationary Attention is devised to recover the intrinsic non-stationary information into temporal dependencies by approximating distinguishable attentions learned from unstationarized series. Our Non-stationary Transformers framework consistently boosts mainstream Transformers by a large margin, which reduces 49.43% MSE on Transformer, 47.34% on Informer, and 46.89% on Reformer, making them the state-of-the-art in time series forecasting.

 - **Abstract**
 Self-supervised learning on large-scale Vision Transformers (ViTs) as pre-training methods has achieved promising downstream performance. Yet, how such pre-training paradigms promote lightweight ViTs' performance is considerably less studied. In this work, we mainly produce recipes for pre-training high-performance lightweight ViTs using masked-image-modeling-based MAE, namely MAE-lite, which achieves 78.4% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet with ViT-Tiny (5.7M). Furthermore, we develop and benchmark other fully-supervised and self-supervised pre-training counterparts, e.g., contrastive-learning-based MoCo-v3, on both ImageNet and other classification tasks. We analyze and clearly show the effect of such pre-training, and reveal that properly-learned lower layers of the pre-trained models matter more than higher ones in data-sufficient downstream tasks. Finally, by further comparing with the pre-trained representations of the up-scaled models, a distillation strategy during pre-training is developed to improve the pre-trained representations as well, leading to further downstream performance improvement. The code and models will be made publicly available.

 - **Abstract**
 Accuracy and Diversity are two essential metrizable manifestations in generating natural and semantically correct captions. Many efforts have been made to enhance one of them with another decayed due to the trade-off gap. However, compromise does not make the progress. Decayed diversity makes the captioner a repeater, and decayed accuracy makes it a fake advisor. In this work, we exploit a novel Variational Transformer framework to improve accuracy and diversity simultaneously. To ensure accuracy, we introduce the "Invisible Information Prior" along with the "Auto-selectable GMM" to instruct the encoder to learn the precise language information and object relation in different scenes. To ensure diversity, we propose the "Range-Median Reward" baseline to retain more diverse candidates with higher rewards during the RL-based training process. Experiments show that our method achieves the simultaneous promotion of accuracy (CIDEr) and diversity (self-CIDEr), up to 1.1 and 4.8 percent, compared with the baseline. Also, our method outperforms others under the newly proposed measurement of the trade-off gap, with at least 3.55 percent promotion.

 - **Abstract**
 The attention mechanism has become a go-to technique for natural language processing and computer vision tasks. Recently, the MLP-Mixer and other MLP-based architectures, based simply on multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs), are also powerful compared to CNNs and attention techniques and raises a new research direction. However, the high capability of the MLP-based networks severely relies on large volume of training data, and lacks of explanation ability compared to the Vision Transformer (ViT) or ConvNets. When trained on small datasets, they usually achieved inferior results than ConvNets. To resolve it, we present (i) multi-dimensional MLP (MDMLP), a conceptually simple and lightweight MLP-based architecture yet achieves SOTA when training from scratch on small-size datasets; (ii) multi-dimension MLP Attention Tool (MDAttnTool), a novel and efficient attention mechanism based on MLPs. Even without strong data augmentation, MDMLP achieves 90.90% accuracy on CIFAR10 with only 0.3M parameters, while the well-known MLP-Mixer achieves 85.45% with 17.1M parameters. In addition, the lightweight MDAttnTool highlights objects in images, indicating its explanation power. Our code is available at https://github.com/Amoza-Theodore/MDMLP.

 - **Abstract**
 Text summarization aims to generate a short summary for an input text. In this work, we propose a Non-Autoregressive Unsupervised Summarization (NAUS) approach, which does not require parallel data for training. Our NAUS first performs edit-based search towards a heuristically defined score, and generates a summary as pseudo-groundtruth. Then, we train an encoder-only non-autoregressive Transformer based on the search result. We also propose a dynamic programming approach for length-control decoding, which is important for the summarization task. Experiments on two datasets show that NAUS achieves state-of-the-art performance for unsupervised summarization, yet largely improving inference efficiency. Further, our algorithm is able to perform explicit length-transfer summary generation.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.14573
 - **Abstract**
 We view the reconstruction of CAD models in the boundary representation (B-Rep) as the detection of geometric primitives of different orders, i.e. vertices, edges and surface patches, and the correspondence of primitives, which are holistically modeled as a chain complex, and show that by modeling such comprehensive structures more complete and regularized reconstructions can be achieved. We solve the complex generation problem in two steps. First, we propose a novel neural framework that consists of a sparse CNN encoder for input point cloud processing and a tri-path transformer decoder for generating geometric primitives and their mutual relationships with estimated probabilities. Second, given the probabilistic structure predicted by the neural network, we recover a definite B-Rep chain complex by solving a global optimization maximizing the likelihood under structural validness constraints and applying geometric refinements. Extensive tests on large scale CAD datasets demonstrate that the modeling of B-Rep chain complex structure enables more accurate detection for learning and more constrained reconstruction for optimization, leading to structurally more faithful and complete CAD B-Rep models than previous results.

 - **Abstract**
 Recently, the transformer model has been successfully employed for the multi-view 3D reconstruction problem. However, challenges remain on designing an attention mechanism to explore the multiview features and exploit their relations for reinforcing the encoding-decoding modules. This paper proposes a new model, namely 3D coarse-to-fine transformer (3D-C2FT), by introducing a novel coarse-to-fine(C2F) attention mechanism for encoding multi-view features and rectifying defective 3D objects. C2F attention mechanism enables the model to learn multi-view information flow and synthesize 3D surface correction in a coarse to fine-grained manner. The proposed model is evaluated by ShapeNet and Multi-view Real-life datasets. Experimental results show that 3D-C2FT achieves notable results and outperforms several competing models on these datasets.

 - **Abstract**
 Existing dialogue modeling methods have achieved promising performance on various dialogue tasks with the aid of Transformer and the large-scale pre-trained language models. However, some recent studies revealed that the context representations produced by these methods suffer the problem of anisotropy. In this paper, we find that the generated representations are also not conversational, losing the conversation structure information during the context modeling stage. To this end, we identify two properties in dialogue modeling, i.e., locality and isotropy, and present a simple method for dialogue representation calibration, namely SimDRC, to build isotropic and conversational feature spaces. Experimental results show that our approach significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art models on three dialogue tasks across the automatic and human evaluation metrics. More in-depth analyses further confirm the effectiveness of our proposed approach.

 - **Abstract**
 Scalable generation of furniture layouts is essential for many applications in virtual reality, augmented reality, game development and synthetic data generation. Many existing methods tackle this problem as a sequence generation problem which imposes a specific ordering on the elements of the layout making such methods impractical for interactive editing or scene completion. Additionally, most methods focus on generating layouts unconditionally and offer minimal control over the generated layouts. We propose COFS, an architecture based on standard transformer architecture blocks from language modeling. The proposed model is invariant to object order by design, removing the unnatural requirement of specifying an object generation order. Furthermore, the model allows for user interaction at multiple levels enabling fine grained control over the generation process. Our model consistently outperforms other methods which we verify by performing quantitative evaluations. Our method is also faster to train and sample from, compared to existing methods.

 - **Abstract**
 Large scale pre-training models have been widely used in named entity recognition (NER) tasks. However, model ensemble through parameter averaging or voting can not give full play to the differentiation advantages of different models, especially in the open domain. This paper describes our NER system in the SemEval 2022 task11: MultiCoNER. We proposed an effective system to adaptively ensemble pre-trained language models by a Transformer layer. By assigning different weights to each model for different inputs, we adopted the Transformer layer to integrate the advantages of diverse models effectively. Experimental results show that our method achieves superior performances in Farsi and Dutch.

 Transformer is a successful deep neural network (DNN) architecture that has shown its versatility not only in natural language processing but also in music information retrieval (MIR). In this paper, we present a novel Transformer-based approach to tackle beat and downbeat tracking. This approach employs SpecTNT (Spectral-Temporal Transformer in Transformer), a variant of Transformer that models both spectral and temporal dimensions of a time-frequency input of music audio. A SpecTNT model uses a stack of blocks, where each consists of two levels of Transformer encoders. The lower-level (or spectral) encoder handles the spectral features and enables the model to pay attention to harmonic components of each frame. Since downbeats indicate bar boundaries and are often accompanied by harmonic changes, this step may help downbeat modeling. The upper-level (or temporal) encoder aggregates useful local spectral information to pay attention to beat/downbeat positions. We also propose an architecture that combines SpecTNT with a state-of-the-art model, Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN), to further improve the performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach can significantly outperform TCN in downbeat tracking while maintaining comparable result in beat tracking.

 Despite being the third most popular language in India, the Marathi language lacks useful NLP resources. Moreover, popular NLP libraries do not have support for the Marathi language. With L3Cube-MahaNLP, we aim to build resources and a library for Marathi natural language processing. We present datasets and transformer models for supervised tasks like sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, and hate speech detection. We have also published a monolingual Marathi corpus for unsupervised language modeling tasks. Overall we present MahaCorpus, MahaSent, MahaNER, and MahaHate datasets and their corresponding MahaBERT models fine-tuned on these datasets. We aim to move ahead of benchmark datasets and prepare useful resources for Marathi. The resources are available at https://github.com/l3cube-pune/MarathiNLP.

 - **Abstract**
 Vision Transformer (ViT) has achieved remarkable performance in many vision tasks. However, ViT is inferior to convolutional neural networks (CNNs) when targeting high-resolution mobile vision applications. The key computational bottleneck of ViT is the softmax attention module which has quadratic computational complexity with the input resolution. It is essential to reduce the cost of ViT to deploy it on edge devices. Existing methods (e.g., Swin, PVT) restrict the softmax attention within local windows or reduce the resolution of key/value tensors to reduce the cost, which sacrifices ViT's core advantages on global feature extractions. In this work, we present EfficientViT, an efficient ViT architecture for high-resolution low-computation visual recognition. Instead of restricting the softmax attention, we propose to replace softmax attention with linear attention while enhancing its local feature extraction ability with depthwise convolution. EfficientViT maintains global and local feature extraction capability while enjoying linear computational complexity. Extensive experiments on COCO object detection and Cityscapes semantic segmentation demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. On the COCO dataset, EfficientViT achieves 42.6 AP with 4.4G MACs, surpassing EfficientDet-D1 by 2.4 AP while having 27.9% fewer MACs. On Cityscapes, EfficientViT reaches 78.7 mIoU with 19.1G MACs, outperforming SegFormer by 2.5 mIoU while requiring less than 1/3 the computational cost. On Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 CPU, EfficientViT is 3x faster than EfficientNet while achieving higher ImageNet accuracy.

 - **Abstract**
 Data Prefetching is a technique that can hide memory latency by fetching data before it is needed by a program. Prefetching relies on accurate memory access prediction, to which task machine learning based methods are increasingly applied. Unlike previous approaches that learn from deltas or offsets and perform one access prediction, we develop TransforMAP, based on the powerful Transformer model, that can learn from the whole address space and perform multiple cache line predictions. We propose to use the binary of memory addresses as model input, which avoids information loss and saves a token table in hardware. We design a block index bitmap to collect unordered future page offsets under the current page address as learning labels. As a result, our model can learn temporal patterns as well as spatial patterns within a page. In a practical implementation, this approach has the potential to hide prediction latency because it prefetches multiple cache lines likely to be used in a long horizon. We show that our approach achieves 35.67% MPKI improvement and 20.55% IPC improvement in simulation, higher than state-of-the-art Best-Offset prefetcher and ISB prefetcher.

 - **Abstract**
 Recurrent neural networks have a strong inductive bias towards learning temporally compressed representations, as the entire history of a sequence is represented by a single vector. By contrast, Transformers have little inductive bias towards learning temporally compressed representations, as they allow for attention over all previously computed elements in a sequence. Having a more compressed representation of a sequence may be beneficial for generalization, as a high-level representation may be more easily re-used and re-purposed and will contain fewer irrelevant details. At the same time, excessive compression of representations comes at the cost of expressiveness. We propose a solution which divides computation into two streams. A slow stream that is recurrent in nature aims to learn a specialized and compressed representation, by forcing chunks of $K$ time steps into a single representation which is divided into multiple vectors. At the same time, a fast stream is parameterized as a Transformer to process chunks consisting of $K$ time-steps conditioned on the information in the slow-stream. In the proposed approach we hope to gain the expressiveness of the Transformer, while encouraging better compression and structuring of representations in the slow stream. We show the benefits of the proposed method in terms of improved sample efficiency and generalization performance as compared to various competitive baselines for visual perception and sequential decision making tasks.

 - **Abstract**
 Adversarial attacks seriously threaten the high accuracy of face anti-spoofing models. Little adversarial noise can perturb their classification of live and spoofing. The existing adversarial attacks fail to figure out which part of the target face anti-spoofing model is vulnerable, making adversarial analysis tricky. So we propose fine-grained attacks for exposing adversarial vulnerability of face anti-spoofing models. Firstly, we propose Semantic Feature Augmentation (SFA) module, which makes adversarial noise semantic-aware to live and spoofing features. SFA considers the contrastive classes of data and texture bias of models in the context of face anti-spoofing, increasing the attack success rate by nearly 40% on average. Secondly, we generate fine-grained adversarial examples based on SFA and the multitask network with auxiliary information. We evaluate three annotations (facial attributes, spoofing types and illumination) and two geometric maps (depth and reflection), on four backbone networks (VGG, Resnet, Densenet and Swin Transformer). We find that facial attributes annotation and state-of-art networks fail to guarantee that models are robust to adversarial attacks. Such adversarial attacks can be generalized to more auxiliary information and backbone networks, to help our community handle the trade-off between accuracy and adversarial robustness.

 - **Abstract**
 More infectious virus variants can arise from rapid mutations in their proteins, creating new infection waves. These variants can evade one's immune system and infect vaccinated individuals, lowering vaccine efficacy. Hence, to improve vaccine design, this project proposes Optimus PPIme - a deep learning approach to predict future, more infectious variants from an existing virus (exemplified by SARS-CoV-2). The approach comprises an algorithm which acts as a "virus" attacking a host cell. To increase infectivity, the "virus" mutates to bind better to the host's receptor. 2 algorithms were attempted - greedy search and beam search. The strength of this variant-host binding was then assessed by a transformer network we developed, with a high accuracy of 90%. With both components, beam search eventually proposed more infectious variants. Therefore, this approach can potentially enable researchers to develop vaccines that provide protection against future infectious variants before they emerge, pre-empting outbreaks and saving lives.

 - **Abstract**
 Challenging illumination conditions (low light, underexposure and overexposure) in the real world not only cast an unpleasant visual appearance but also taint the computer vision tasks. Existing light adaptive methods often deal with each condition individually. What is more, most of them often operate on a RAW image or over-simplify the camera image signal processing (ISP) pipeline. By decomposing the light transformation pipeline into local and global ISP components, we propose a lightweight fast Illumination Adaptive Transformer (IAT) which comprises two transformer-style branches: local estimation branch and global ISP branch. While the local branch estimates the pixel-wise local components relevant to illumination, the global branch defines learnable quires that attend the whole image to decode the parameters. Our IAT could also conduct both object detection and semantic segmentation under various light conditions. We have extensively evaluated IAT on multiple real-world datasets on 2 low-level tasks and 3 high-level tasks. With only 90k parameters and 0.004s processing speed (excluding high-level module), our IAT has consistently achieved superior performance over SOTA.

 - **Abstract**
 Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have shown promising results for the task of Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) but they still fall behind Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)/Transformer based models in terms of performance. In this paper, we propose a CNN based architecture that bridges this gap. Our work, Easter2.0, is composed of multiple layers of 1D Convolution, Batch Normalization, ReLU, Dropout, Dense Residual connection, Squeeze-and-Excitation module and make use of Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss. In addition to the Easter2.0 architecture, we propose a simple and effective data augmentation technique 'Tiling and Corruption (TACO)' relevant for the task of HTR/OCR. Our work achieves state-of-the-art results on IAM handwriting database when trained using only publicly available training data. In our experiments, we also present the impact of TACO augmentations and Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) on text recognition accuracy. We further show that Easter2.0 is suitable for few-shot learning tasks and outperforms current best methods including Transformers when trained on limited amount of annotated data.

 - **Abstract**
 While separately leveraging monocular 3D object detection and 2D multi-object tracking can be straightforwardly applied to sequence images in a frame-by-frame fashion, stand-alone tracker cuts off the transmission of the uncertainty from the 3D detector to tracking while cannot pass tracking error differentials back to the 3D detector. In this work, we propose jointly training 3D detection and 3D tracking from only monocular videos in an end-to-end manner. The key component is a novel spatial-temporal information flow module that aggregates geometric and appearance features to predict robust similarity scores across all objects in current and past frames. Specifically, we leverage the attention mechanism of the transformer, in which self-attention aggregates the spatial information in a specific frame, and cross-attention exploits relation and affinities of all objects in the temporal domain of sequence frames. The affinities are then supervised to estimate the trajectory and guide the flow of information between corresponding 3D objects. In addition, we propose a temporal -consistency loss that explicitly involves 3D target motion modeling into the learning, making the 3D trajectory smooth in the world coordinate system. Time3D achieves 21.4\% AMOTA, 13.6\% AMOTP on the nuScenes 3D tracking benchmark, surpassing all published competitors, and running at 38 FPS, while Time3D achieves 31.2\% mAP, 39.4\% NDS on the nuScenes 3D detection benchmark.

 - **Abstract**
 Recently, masked image modeling (MIM) has offered a new methodology of self-supervised pre-training of vision transformers. A key idea of efficient implementation is to discard the masked image patches (or tokens) throughout the target network (encoder), which requires the encoder to be a plain vision transformer (e.g., ViT), albeit hierarchical vision transformers (e.g., Swin Transformer) have potentially better properties in formulating vision inputs. In this paper, we offer a new design of hierarchical vision transformers named HiViT (short for Hierarchical ViT) that enjoys both high efficiency and good performance in MIM. The key is to remove the unnecessary "local inter-unit operations", deriving structurally simple hierarchical vision transformers in which mask-units can be serialized like plain vision transformers. For this purpose, we start with Swin Transformer and (i) set the masking unit size to be the token size in the main stage of Swin Transformer, (ii) switch off inter-unit self-attentions before the main stage, and (iii) eliminate all operations after the main stage. Empirical studies demonstrate the advantageous performance of HiViT in terms of fully-supervised, self-supervised, and transfer learning. In particular, in running MAE on ImageNet-1K, HiViT-B reports a +0.6% accuracy gain over ViT-B and a 1.9$\times$ speed-up over Swin-B, and the performance gain generalizes to downstream tasks of detection and segmentation. Code will be made publicly available.

 - **Abstract**
 Large sequence model (SM) such as GPT series and BERT has displayed outstanding performance and generalization capabilities on vision, language, and recently reinforcement learning tasks. A natural follow-up question is how to abstract multi-agent decision making into an SM problem and benefit from the prosperous development of SMs. In this paper, we introduce a novel architecture named Multi-Agent Transformer (MAT) that effectively casts cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) into SM problems wherein the task is to map agents' observation sequence to agents' optimal action sequence. Our goal is to build the bridge between MARL and SMs so that the modeling power of modern sequence models can be unleashed for MARL. Central to our MAT is an encoder-decoder architecture which leverages the multi-agent advantage decomposition theorem to transform the joint policy search problem into a sequential decision making process; this renders only linear time complexity for multi-agent problems and, most importantly, endows MAT with monotonic performance improvement guarantee. Unlike prior arts such as Decision Transformer fit only pre-collected offline data, MAT is trained by online trials and errors from the environment in an on-policy fashion. To validate MAT, we conduct extensive experiments on StarCraftII, Multi-Agent MuJoCo, Dexterous Hands Manipulation, and Google Research Football benchmarks. Results demonstrate that MAT achieves superior performance and data efficiency compared to strong baselines including MAPPO and HAPPO. Furthermore, we demonstrate that MAT is an excellent few-short learner on unseen tasks regardless of changes in the number of agents.

 - **Abstract**
 Vision transformers have generated significant interest in the computer vision community because of their flexibility in exploiting contextual information, whether it is sharply confined local, or long range global. However, they are known to be data hungry. This has motivated the research in self-supervised transformer pretraining, which does not need to decode the semantic information conveyed by labels to link it to the image properties, but rather focuses directly on extracting a concise representation of the image data that reflects the notion of similarity, and is invariant to nuisance factors. The key vehicle for the self-learning process used by the majority of self-learning methods is the generation of multiple views of the training data and the creation of pretext tasks which use these views to define the notion of image similarity, and data integrity. However, this approach lacks the natural propensity to extract contextual information. We propose group masked model learning (GMML), a self-supervised learning (SSL) mechanism for pretraining vision transformers with the ability to extract the contextual information present in all the concepts in an image. GMML achieves this by manipulating randomly groups of connected tokens, ensuingly covering a meaningful part of a semantic concept, and then recovering the hidden semantic information from the visible part of the concept. GMML implicitly introduces a novel data augmentation process. Unlike most of the existing SSL approaches, GMML does not require momentum encoder, nor rely on careful implementation details such as large batches and gradient stopping, which are all artefacts of most of the current self-supervised learning techniques. The source code is publicly available for the community to train on bigger corpora: https://github.com/Sara-Ahmed/GMML.

 - **Abstract**
 Point cloud completion task aims to predict the missing part of incomplete point clouds and generate complete point clouds with details. In this paper, we propose a novel point cloud completion network, CompleteDT, which is based on the transformer. CompleteDT can learn features within neighborhoods and explore the relationship among these neighborhoods. By sampling the incomplete point cloud to obtain point clouds with different resolutions, we extract features from these point clouds in a self-guided manner, while converting these features into a series of $patches$ based on the geometrical structure. To facilitate transformers to leverage sufficient information about point clouds, we provide a plug-and-play module named Relation-Augment Attention Module (RAA), consisting of Point Cross-Attention Module (PCA) and Point Dense Multi-Scale Attention Module (PDMA). These two modules can enhance the ability to learn features within Patches and consider the correlation among these Patches. Thus, RAA enables to learn structures of incomplete point clouds and contribute to infer the local details of complete point clouds generated. In addition, we predict the complete shape from $patches$ with an efficient generation module, namely, Multi-resolution Point Fusion Module (MPF). MPF gradually generates complete point clouds from $patches$, and updates $patches$ based on these generated point clouds. Experimental results show that our method largely outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.
### Robotic grasp detection based on Transformer

 - **Abstract**
 Grasp detection in a cluttered environment is still a great challenge for robots. Currently, the Transformer mechanism has been successfully applied to visual tasks, and its excellent ability of global context information extraction provides a feasible way to improve the performance of robotic grasp detection in cluttered scenes. However, the insufficient inductive bias ability of the original Transformer model requires large-scale datasets training, which is difficult to obtain for grasp detection. In this paper, we propose a grasp detection model based on encoder-decoder structure. The encoder uses a Transformer network to extract global context information. The decoder uses a fully convolutional neural network to improve the inductive bias capability of the model and combine features extracted by the encoder to predict the final grasp configuration. Experiments on the VMRD dataset demonstrate that our model performs much better in overlapping object scenes. Meanwhile, on the Cornell Grasp dataset, our approach achieves an accuracy of 98.1%, which is comparable with state-of-the-art algorithms.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a new self-supervised pre-training of Vision Transformers for dense prediction tasks. It is based on a contrastive loss across views that compares pixel-level representations to global image representations. This strategy produces better local features suitable for dense prediction tasks as opposed to contrastive pre-training based on global image representation only. Furthermore, our approach does not suffer from a reduced batch size since the number of negative examples needed in the contrastive loss is in the order of the number of local features. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our pre-training strategy on two dense prediction tasks: semantic segmentation and monocular depth estimation.

 A longstanding goal of the field of AI is a strategy for compiling diverse experience into a highly capable, generalist agent. In the subfields of vision and language, this was largely achieved by scaling up transformer-based models and training them on large, diverse datasets. Motivated by this progress, we investigate whether the same strategy can be used to produce generalist reinforcement learning agents. Specifically, we show that a single transformer-based model - with a single set of weights - trained purely offline can play a suite of up to 46 Atari games simultaneously at close-to-human performance. When trained and evaluated appropriately, we find that the same trends observed in language and vision hold, including scaling of performance with model size and rapid adaptation to new games via fine-tuning. We compare several approaches in this multi-game setting, such as online and offline RL methods and behavioral cloning, and find that our Multi-Game Decision Transformer models offer the best scalability and performance. We release the pre-trained models and code to encourage further research in this direction. Additional information, videos and code can be seen at: sites.google.com/view/multi-game-transformers

 - **Abstract**
 Lung cancer is the cancer leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) are the most common histologic subtypes of NSCLC. Histology is an essential tool for lung cancer diagnosis. Pathologists make classifications according to the dominant subtypes. Although morphology remains the standard for diagnosis, significant tool needs to be developed to elucidate the diagnosis. In our study, we utilize the pre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT) model to classify multiple label lung cancer on histologic slices (from dataset LC25000), in both Zero-Shot and Few-Shot manners. Then we compare the performance of Zero-Shot and Few-Shot ViT on accuracy, precision, recall, sensitivity and specificity. Our study show that the pre-trained ViT model has a good performance in Zero-Shot setting, a competitive accuracy ($99.87\%$) in Few-Shot setting ({epoch = 1}) and an optimal result ($100.00\%$) in Few-Shot seeting ({epoch = 5}).

 - **Abstract**
 Unlike literal expressions, idioms' meanings do not directly follow from their parts, posing a challenge for neural machine translation (NMT). NMT models are often unable to translate idioms accurately and over-generate compositional, literal translations. In this work, we investigate whether the non-compositionality of idioms is reflected in the mechanics of the dominant NMT model, Transformer, by analysing the hidden states and attention patterns for models with English as source language and one of seven European languages as target language. When Transformer emits a non-literal translation - i.e. identifies the expression as idiomatic - the encoder processes idioms more strongly as single lexical units compared to literal expressions. This manifests in idioms' parts being grouped through attention and in reduced interaction between idioms and their context. In the decoder's cross-attention, figurative inputs result in reduced attention on source-side tokens. These results suggest that Transformer's tendency to process idioms as compositional expressions contributes to literal translations of idioms.

 - **Abstract**
 We propose a differentiable rendering algorithm for efficient novel view synthesis. By departing from volume-based representations in favor of a learned point representation, we improve on existing methods more than an order of magnitude in memory and runtime, both in training and inference. The method begins with a uniformly-sampled random point cloud and learns per-point position and view-dependent appearance, using a differentiable splat-based renderer to evolve the model to match a set of input images. Our method is up to 300x faster than NeRF in both training and inference, with only a marginal sacrifice in quality, while using less than 10~MB of memory for a static scene. For dynamic scenes, our method trains two orders of magnitude faster than STNeRF and renders at near interactive rate, while maintaining high image quality and temporal coherence even without imposing any temporal-coherency regularizers.

 - **Abstract**
 Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) has emerged as a compelling method to represent 3D objects and scenes for photo-realistic rendering. However, its implicit representation causes difficulty in manipulating the models like the explicit mesh representation. Several recent advances in NeRF manipulation are usually restricted by a shared renderer network, or suffer from large model size. To circumvent the hurdle, in this paper, we present an explicit neural field representation that enables efficient and convenient manipulation of models. To achieve this goal, we learn a hybrid tensor rank decomposition of the scene without neural networks. Motivated by the low-rank approximation property of the SVD algorithm, we propose a rank-residual learning strategy to encourage the preservation of primary information in lower ranks. The model size can then be dynamically adjusted by rank truncation to control the levels of detail, achieving near-optimal compression without extra optimization. Furthermore, different models can be arbitrarily transformed and composed into one scene by concatenating along the rank dimension. The growth of storage cost can also be mitigated by compressing the unimportant objects in the composed scene. We demonstrate that our method is able to achieve comparable rendering quality to state-of-the-art methods, while enabling extra capability of compression and composition.

 - **Abstract**
 We introduce an approach for selecting objects in neural volumetric 3D representations, such as multi-plane images (MPI) and neural radiance fields (NeRF). Our approach takes a set of foreground and background 2D user scribbles in one view and automatically estimates a 3D segmentation of the desired object, which can be rendered into novel views. To achieve this result, we propose a novel voxel feature embedding that incorporates the neural volumetric 3D representation and multi-view image features from all input views. To evaluate our approach, we introduce a new dataset of human-provided segmentation masks for depicted objects in real-world multi-view scene captures. We show that our approach out-performs strong baselines, including 2D segmentation and 3D segmentation approaches adapted to our task.

 - **Abstract**
 Neural radiance fields (NeRF) have shown great success in modeling 3D scenes and synthesizing novel-view images. However, most previous NeRF methods take much time to optimize one single scene. Explicit data structures, e.g. voxel features, show great potential to accelerate the training process. However, voxel features face two big challenges to be applied to dynamic scenes, i.e. modeling temporal information and capturing different scales of point motions. We propose a radiance field framework by representing scenes with time-aware voxel features, named as TiNeuVox. A tiny coordinate deformation network is introduced to model coarse motion trajectories and temporal information is further enhanced in the radiance network. A multi-distance interpolation method is proposed and applied on voxel features to model both small and large motions. Our framework significantly accelerates the optimization of dynamic radiance fields while maintaining high rendering quality. Empirical evaluation is performed on both synthetic and real scenes. Our TiNeuVox completes training with only 8 minutes and 8-MB storage cost while showing similar or even better rendering performance than previous dynamic NeRF methods.
