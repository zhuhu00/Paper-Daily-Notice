 - **Abstract**
 Visual Inertial Odometry (VIO) is one of the most established state estimation methods for mobile platforms. However, when visual tracking fails, VIO algorithms quickly diverge due to rapid error accumulation during inertial data integration. This error is typically modeled as a combination of additive Gaussian noise and a slowly changing bias which evolves as a random walk. In this work, we propose to train a neural network to learn the true bias evolution. We implement and compare two common sequential deep learning architectures: LSTMs and Transformers. Our approach follows from recent learning-based inertial estimators, but, instead of learning a motion model, we target IMU bias explicitly, which allows us to generalize to locomotion patterns unseen in training. We show that our proposed method improves state estimation in visually challenging situations across a wide range of motions by quadrupedal robots, walking humans, and drones. Our experiments show an average 15% reduction in drift rate, with much larger reductions when there is total vision failure. Importantly, we also demonstrate that models trained with one locomotion pattern (human walking) can be applied to another (quadruped robot trotting) without retraining.

 - **Abstract**
 Studying animal movements is essential for effective wildlife conservation and conflict mitigation. For aerial movements, operational weather radars have become an indispensable data source in this respect. However, partial measurements, incomplete spatial coverage, and poor understanding of animal behaviours make it difficult to reconstruct complete spatio-temporal movement patterns from available radar data. We tackle this inverse problem by learning a mapping from high-dimensional radar measurements to low-dimensional latent representations using a convolutional encoder. Under the assumption that the latent system dynamics are well approximated by a locally linear Gaussian transition model, we perform efficient posterior estimation using the classical Kalman smoother. A convolutional decoder maps the inferred latent system states back to the physical space in which the known radar observation model can be applied, enabling fully unsupervised training. To encourage physical consistency, we additionally introduce a physics-informed loss term that leverages known mass conservation constraints. Our experiments on synthetic radar data show promising results in terms of reconstruction quality and data-efficiency.

 - **Abstract**
 It has been widely observed in the machine learning community that a small perturbation to the input can cause a large change in the prediction of a trained model, and such phenomena have been intensively studied in the machine learning community under the name of adversarial attacks. Because graph algorithms also are widely used for decision making and knowledge discovery, it is important to design graph algorithms that are robust against adversarial attacks. In this study, we consider the Lipschitz continuity of algorithms as a robustness measure and initiate a systematic study of the Lipschitz continuity of algorithms for (weighted) graph problems. Depending on how we embed the output solution to a metric space, we can think of several Lipschitzness notions. We mainly consider the one that is invariant under scaling of weights, and we provide Lipschitz continuous algorithms and lower bounds for the minimum spanning tree problem, the shortest path problem, and the maximum weight matching problem. In particular, our shortest path algorithm is obtained by first designing an algorithm for unweighted graphs that are robust against edge contractions and then applying it to the unweighted graph constructed from the original weighted graph. Then, we consider another Lipschitzness notion induced by a natural mapping that maps the output solution to its characteristic vector. It turns out that no Lipschitz continuous algorithm exists for this Lipschitz notion, and we instead design algorithms with bounded pointwise Lipschitz constants for the minimum spanning tree problem and the maximum weight bipartite matching problem. Our algorithm for the latter problem is based on an LP relaxation with entropy regularization.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper is about an extraordinary phenomenon. Suppose we don't use any low-light images as training data, can we enhance a low-light image by deep learning? Obviously, current methods cannot do this, since deep neural networks require to train their scads of parameters using copious amounts of training data, especially task-related data. In this paper, we show that in the context of fundamental deep learning, it is possible to enhance a low-light image without any task-related training data. Technically, we propose a new, magical, effective and efficient method, termed \underline{Noi}se \underline{SE}lf-\underline{R}egression (NoiSER), which learns a gray-world mapping from Gaussian distribution for low-light image enhancement (LLIE). Specifically, a self-regression model is built as a carrier to learn a gray-world mapping during training, which is performed by simply iteratively feeding random noise. During inference, a low-light image is directly fed into the learned mapping to yield a normal-light one. Extensive experiments show that our NoiSER is highly competitive to current task-related data based LLIE models in terms of quantitative and visual results, while outperforming them in terms of the number of parameters, training time and inference speed. With only about 1K parameters, NoiSER realizes about 1 minute for training and 1.2 ms for inference with 600$\times$400 resolution on RTX 2080 Ti. Besides, NoiSER has an inborn automated exposure suppression capability and can automatically adjust too bright or too dark, without additional manipulations.

 - **Abstract**
 Global localisation from visual data is a challenging problem applicable to many robotics domains. Prior works have shown that neural networks can be trained to map images of an environment to absolute camera pose within that environment, learning an implicit neural mapping in the process. In this work we evaluate the applicability of such an approach to real-world robotics scenarios, demonstrating that by constraining the problem to 2-dimensions and significantly increasing the quantity of training data, a compact model capable of real-time inference on embedded platforms can be used to achieve localisation accuracy of several centimetres. We deploy our trained model onboard a UGV platform, demonstrating its effectiveness in a waypoint navigation task. Along with this work we will release a novel localisation dataset comprising simulated and real environments, each with training samples numbering in the tens of thousands.

 - **Abstract**
 The continuous increase in global population and the impact of climate change on crop production are expected to affect the food sector significantly. In this context, there is need for timely, large-scale and precise mapping of crops for evidence-based decision making. A key enabler towards this direction are new satellite missions that freely offer big remote sensing data of high spatio-temporal resolution and global coverage. During the previous decade and because of this surge of big Earth observations, deep learning methods have dominated the remote sensing and crop mapping literature. Nevertheless, deep learning models require large amounts of annotated data that are scarce and hard-to-acquire. To address this problem, transfer learning methods can be used to exploit available annotations and enable crop mapping for other regions, crop types and years of inspection. In this work, we have developed and trained a deep learning model for paddy rice detection in South Korea using Sentinel-1 VH time-series. We then fine-tune the model for i) paddy rice detection in France and Spain and ii) barley detection in the Netherlands. Additionally, we propose a modification in the pre-trained weights in order to incorporate extra input features (Sentinel-1 VV). Our approach shows excellent performance when transferring in different areas for the same crop type and rather promising results when transferring in a different area and crop type.

 - **Abstract**
 Blockchain technology has been integrated into diverse software applications by enabling a decentralised architecture design. However, the defects of on-chain algorithmic mechanisms, and tedious disputes and debates in off-chain communities may affect the operation of blockchain systems. Accordingly, blockchain governance has received great interest for supporting the design, use, and maintenance of blockchain systems, hence improving the overall trustworthiness. Although much effort has been put into this research topic, there is a distinct lack of consideration for blockchain governance from the perspective of software architecture design. In this study, we propose a pattern-oriented reference architecture for governance-driven blockchain systems, which can provide guidance for future blockchain architecture design. We design the reference architecture based on an extensive review of architecture patterns for blockchain governance in academic literature and industry implementation. The reference architecture consists of four layers. We demonstrate the components in each layer, annotating with the identified patterns. A qualitative analysis of mapping two concrete blockchain architectures, Polkadot and Quorum, on the reference architecture is conducted, to evaluate the correctness and utility of proposed reference architecture.

 - **Abstract**
 Prescriptive Process Monitoring systems recommend, during the execution of a business process, interventions that, if followed, prevent a negative outcome of the process. Such interventions have to be reliable, that is, they have to guarantee the achievement of the desired outcome or performance, and they have to be flexible, that is, they have to avoid overturning the normal process execution or forcing the execution of a given activity. Most of the existing Prescriptive Process Monitoring solutions, however, while performing well in terms of recommendation reliability, provide the users with very specific (sequences of) activities that have to be executed without caring about the feasibility of these recommendations. In order to face this issue, we propose a new Outcome-Oriented Prescriptive Process Monitoring system recommending temporal relations between activities that have to be guaranteed during the process execution in order to achieve a desired outcome. This softens the mandatory execution of an activity at a given point in time, thus leaving more freedom to the user in deciding the interventions to put in place. Our approach defines these temporal relations with Linear Temporal Logic over finite traces patterns that are used as features to describe the historical process data recorded in an event log by the information systems supporting the execution of the process. Such encoded log is used to train a Machine Learning classifier to learn a mapping between the temporal patterns and the outcome of a process execution. The classifier is then queried at runtime to return as recommendations the most salient temporal patterns to be satisfied to maximize the likelihood of a certain outcome for an input ongoing process execution. The proposed system is assessed using a pool of 22 real-life event logs that have already been used as a benchmark in the Process Mining community.

### Kalman Filter-based Sensing in Communication Systems with Clock  Asynchronism

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04644
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.04644
 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we propose a novel Kalman Filter (KF)-based uplink (UL) joint communication and sensing (JCAS) scheme, which can significantly reduce the range and location estimation errors due to the clock asynchronism between the base station (BS) and user equipment (UE). Clock asynchronism causes time-varying time offset (TO) and carrier frequency offset (CFO), leading to major challenges in uplink sensing. Unlike existing technologies, our scheme does not require knowing the location of the UE in advance, and retains the linearity of the sensing parameter estimation problem. We first estimate the angle-of-arrivals (AoAs) of multipaths and use them to spatially filter the CSI. Then, we propose a KF-based CSI enhancer that exploits the estimation of Doppler with CFO as the prior information to significantly suppress the time-varying noise-like TO terms in spatially filtered CSIs. Subsequently, we can estimate the accurate ranges of UE and the scatterers based on the KF-enhanced CSI. Finally, we identify the UE's AoA and range estimation and locate UE, then locate the dumb scatterers using the bi-static system. Simulation results validate the proposed scheme. The localization root mean square error of the proposed method is about 20 dB lower than the benchmarking scheme.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent advances in digital microfluidic (DMF) technologies offer a promising platform for a wide variety of biochemical applications, such as DNA analysis, automated drug discovery, and toxicity monitoring. For on-chip implementation of complex bioassays, automated synthesis tools have been developed to meet the design challenges. Currently, the synthesis tools pass through a number of complex design steps to realize a given biochemical protocol on a target DMF architecture. Thus, design errors can arise during the synthesis steps. Before deploying a DMF biochip on a safety critical system, it is necessary to ensure that the desired biochemical protocol has been correctly implemented, i.e., the synthesized output (actuation sequences for the biochip) is free from any design or realization errors. We propose a symbolic constraint-based analysis framework for checking the correctness of a synthesized biochemical protocol with respect to the original design specification. The verification scheme based on this framework can detect several post-synthesis fluidic violations and realization errors in 2D-array based or pin-constrained biochips as well as in cyberphysical systems. It further generates diagnostic feedback for error localization. We present experimental results on the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and in-vitro multiplexed bioassays to demonstrate the proposed verification approach.

 - **Abstract**
 Online Temporal Action Localization (On-TAL) aims to immediately provide action instances from untrimmed streaming videos. The model is not allowed to utilize future frames and any processing techniques to modify past predictions, making On-TAL much more challenging. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective framework, termed SimOn, that learns to predict action instances using the popular Transformer architecture in an end-to-end manner. Specifically, the model takes the current frame feature as a query and a set of past context information as keys and values of the Transformer. Different from the prior work that uses a set of outputs of the model as past contexts, we leverage the past visual context and the learnable context embedding for the current query. Experimental results on the THUMOS14 and ActivityNet1.3 datasets show that our model remarkably outperforms the previous methods, achieving a new state-of-the-art On-TAL performance. In addition, the evaluation for Online Detection of Action Start (ODAS) demonstrates the effectiveness and robustness of our method in the online setting.

 - **Abstract**
 Pipeline parallelism has achieved great success in deploying large-scale transformer models in cloud environments, but has received less attention in edge environments. Unlike in cloud scenarios with high-speed and stable network interconnects, dynamic bandwidth in edge systems can degrade distributed pipeline performance. We address this issue with QuantPipe, a communication-efficient distributed edge system that introduces post-training quantization (PTQ) to compress the communicated tensors. QuantPipe uses adaptive PTQ to change bitwidths in response to bandwidth dynamics, maintaining transformer pipeline performance while incurring limited inference accuracy loss. We further improve the accuracy with a directed-search analytical clipping for integer quantization method (DS-ACIQ), which bridges the gap between estimated and real data distributions. Experimental results show that QuantPipe adapts to dynamic bandwidth to maintain pipeline performance while achieving a practical model accuracy using a wide range of quantization bitwidths, e.g., improving accuracy under 2-bit quantization by 15.85\% on ImageNet compared to naive quantization.

Our experiments show an average 15% reduction in drift rate, with much larger reductions when there is total vision failure. Importantly, we also demonstrate that models trained with one locomotion pattern (human walking) can be applied to another (quadruped robot trotting) without retraining.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.04583
 - **Abstract**
 Offline reinforcement-learning (RL) algorithms learn to make decisions using a given, fixed training dataset without the possibility of additional online data collection. This problem setting is captivating because it holds the promise of utilizing previously collected datasets without any costly or risky interaction with the environment. However, this promise also bears the drawback of this setting. The restricted dataset induces subjective uncertainty because the agent can encounter unfamiliar sequences of states and actions that the training data did not cover. Moreover, inherent system stochasticity further increases uncertainty and aggravates the offline RL problem, preventing the agent from learning an optimal policy. To mitigate the destructive uncertainty effects, we need to balance the aspiration to take reward-maximizing actions with the incurred risk due to incorrect ones. In financial economics, modern portfolio theory (MPT) is a method that risk-averse investors can use to construct diversified portfolios that maximize their returns without unacceptable levels of risk. We integrate MPT into the agent's decision-making process to present a simple-yet-highly-effective risk-aware planning algorithm for offline RL. Our algorithm allows us to systematically account for the \emph{estimated quality} of specific actions and their \emph{estimated risk} due to the uncertainty. We show that our approach can be coupled with the Transformer architecture to yield a state-of-the-art planner for offline RL tasks, maximizing the return while significantly reducing the variance.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.04604
 - **Abstract**
 Robots operating in human environments must be able to rearrange objects into semantically-meaningful configurations, even if these objects are previously unseen. In this work, we focus on the problem of building physically-valid structures without step-by-step instructions. We propose StructDiffusion, which combines a diffusion model and an object-centric transformer to construct structures out of a single RGB-D image based on high-level language goals, such as "set the table." Our method shows how diffusion models can be used for complex multi-step 3D planning tasks. StructDiffusion improves success rate on assembling physically-valid structures out of unseen objects by on average 16% over an existing multi-modal transformer model, while allowing us to use one multi-task model to produce a wider range of different structures. We show experiments on held-out objects in both simulation and on real-world rearrangement tasks. For videos and additional results, check out our website: this http URL

 - **Abstract**
 3D point cloud registration is a fundamental problem in computer vision and robotics. Recently, learning-based point cloud registration methods have made great progress. However, these methods are sensitive to outliers, which lead to more incorrect correspondences. In this paper, we propose a novel deep graph matching-based framework for point cloud registration. Specifically, we first transform point clouds into graphs and extract deep features for each point. Then, we develop a module based on deep graph matching to calculate a soft correspondence matrix. By using graph matching, not only the local geometry of each point but also its structure and topology in a larger range are considered in establishing correspondences, so that more correct correspondences are found. We train the network with a loss directly defined on the correspondences, and in the test stage the soft correspondences are transformed into hard one-to-one correspondences so that registration can be performed by a correspondence-based solver. Furthermore, we introduce a transformer-based method to generate edges for graph construction, which further improves the quality of the correspondences. Extensive experiments on object-level and scene-level benchmark datasets show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.04699
 - **Abstract**
 To accomplish punctuation restoration, most existing methods focus on introducing extra information (e.g., part-of-speech) or addressing the class imbalance problem. Recently, large-scale transformer-based pre-trained language models (PLMS) have been utilized widely and obtained remarkable success. However, the PLMS are trained on the large dataset with marks, which may not fit well with the small dataset without marks, causing the convergence to be not ideal. In this study, we propose a Feature Fusion two-stream framework (FF2) to bridge the gap. Specifically, one stream leverages a pre-trained language model to capture the semantic feature, while another auxiliary module captures the feature at hand. We also modify the computation of multi-head attention to encourage communication among heads. Then, two features with different perspectives are aggregated to fuse information and enhance context awareness. Without additional data, the experimental results on the popular benchmark IWSLT demonstrate that FF2 achieves new SOTA performance, which verifies that our approach is effective.

 - **Abstract**
 Audio Spectrogram Transformer models rule the field of Audio Tagging, outrunning previously dominating Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Their superiority is based on the ability to scale up and exploit large-scale datasets such as AudioSet. However, Transformers are demanding in terms of model size and computational requirements compared to CNNs. We propose a training procedure for efficient CNNs based on offline Knowledge Distillation (KD) from high-performing yet complex transformers. The proposed training schema and the efficient CNN design based on MobileNetV3 results in models outperforming previous solutions in terms of parameter and computational efficiency and prediction performance. We provide models of different complexity levels, scaling from low-complexity models up to a new state-of-the-art performance of .483 mAP on AudioSet.

 - **Abstract**
 Scene Graph Generation (SGG) serves a comprehensive representation of the images for human understanding as well as visual understanding tasks. Due to the long tail bias problem of the object and predicate labels in the available annotated data, the scene graph generated from current methodologies can be biased toward common, non-informative relationship labels. Relationship can sometimes be non-mutually exclusive, which can be described from multiple perspectives like geometrical relationships or semantic relationships, making it even more challenging to predict the most suitable relationship label. In this work, we proposed the SG-Shuffle pipeline for scene graph generation with 3 components: 1) Parallel Transformer Encoder, which learns to predict object relationships in a more exclusive manner by grouping relationship labels into groups of similar purpose; 2) Shuffle Transformer, which learns to select the final relationship labels from the category-specific feature generated in the previous step; and 3) Weighted CE loss, used to alleviate the training bias caused by the imbalanced dataset.
### Masked Vision-Language Transformers for Scene Text Recognition

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.04785
 - **Abstract**
 Scene text recognition (STR) enables computers to recognize and read the text in various real-world scenes. Recent STR models benefit from taking linguistic information in addition to visual cues into consideration. We propose a novel Masked Vision-Language Transformers (MVLT) to capture both the explicit and the implicit linguistic information. Our encoder is a Vision Transformer, and our decoder is a multi-modal Transformer. MVLT is trained in two stages: in the first stage, we design a STR-tailored pretraining method based on a masking strategy; in the second stage, we fine-tune our model and adopt an iterative correction method to improve the performance. MVLT attains superior results compared to state-of-the-art STR models on several benchmarks. Our code and model are available at https://github.com/onealwj/MVLT.

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04793
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.04793
 - **Abstract**
 We propose a novel deep neural network architecture to learn interpretable representation for medical image analysis. Our architecture generates a global attention for region of interest, and then learns bag of words style deep feature embeddings with local attention. The global, and local feature maps are combined using a contemporary transformer architecture for highly accurate Gallbladder Cancer (GBC) detection from Ultrasound (USG) images. Our experiments indicate that the detection accuracy of our model beats even human radiologists, and advocates its use as the second reader for GBC diagnosis. Bag of words embeddings allow our model to be probed for generating interpretable explanations for GBC detection consistent with the ones reported in medical literature. We show that the proposed model not only helps understand decisions of neural network models but also aids in discovery of new visual features relevant to the diagnosis of GBC.

 - **Abstract**
 Dual-encoder-based neural retrieval models achieve appreciable performance and complement traditional lexical retrievers well due to their semantic matching capabilities, which makes them a common choice for hybrid IR systems. However, these models exhibit a performance bottleneck in the online query encoding step, as the corresponding query encoders are usually large and complex Transformer models. In this paper we investigate heterogeneous dual-encoder models, where the two encoders are separate models that do not share parameters or initializations. We empirically show that heterogeneous dual-encoders are susceptible to collapsing representations, causing them to output constant trivial representations when they are fine-tuned using a standard contrastive loss due to a distribution mismatch. We propose DAFT, a simple two-stage fine-tuning approach that aligns the two encoders in order to prevent them from collapsing. We further demonstrate how DAFT can be used to train efficient heterogeneous dual-encoder models using lightweight query encoders.

 - **Abstract**
 Scene text recognition (STR) involves the task of reading text in cropped images of natural scenes. Conventional models in STR employ convolutional neural network (CNN) followed by recurrent neural network in an encoder-decoder framework. In recent times, the transformer architecture is being widely adopted in STR as it shows strong capability in capturing long-term dependency which appears to be prominent in scene text images. Many researchers utilized transformer as part of a hybrid CNN-transformer encoder, often followed by a transformer decoder. However, such methods only make use of the long-term dependency mid-way through the encoding process. Although the vision transformer (ViT) is able to capture such dependency at an early stage, its utilization remains largely unexploited in STR. This work proposes the use of a transformer-only model as a simple baseline which outperforms hybrid CNN-transformer models. Furthermore, two key areas for improvement were identified. Firstly, the first decoded character has the lowest prediction accuracy. Secondly, images of different original aspect ratios react differently to the patch resolutions while ViT only employ one fixed patch resolution. To explore these areas, Pure Transformer with Integrated Experts (PTIE) is proposed. PTIE is a transformer model that can process multiple patch resolutions and decode in both the original and reverse character orders. It is examined on 7 commonly used benchmarks and compared with over 20 state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms them and obtains state-of-the-art results in most benchmarks.

 - **Abstract**
 Dyadic and small group collaboration is an evolutionary advantageous behaviour and the need for such collaboration is a regular occurrence in day to day life. In this paper we estimate the perceived personality traits of individuals in dyadic and small groups over thin-slices of interaction on four multimodal datasets. We find that our transformer based predictive model performs similarly to human annotators tasked with predicting the perceived big-five personality traits of participants. Using this model we analyse the estimated perceived personality traits of individuals performing tasks in small groups and dyads. Permutation analysis shows that in the case of small groups undergoing collaborative tasks, the perceived personality of group members clusters, this is also observed for dyads in a collaborative problem solving task, but not in dyads under non-collaborative task settings. Additionally, we find that the group level average perceived personality traits provide a better predictor of group performance than the group level average self-reported personality traits.

 - **Abstract**
 Scene text images have different shapes and are subjected to various distortions, e.g. perspective distortions. To handle these challenges, the state-of-the-art methods rely on a rectification network, which is connected to the text recognition network. They form a linear pipeline which uses text rectification on all input images, even for images that can be recognized without it. Undoubtedly, the rectification network improves the overall text recognition performance. However, in some cases, the rectification network generates unnecessary distortions on images, resulting in incorrect predictions in images that would have otherwise been correct without it. In order to alleviate the unnecessary distortions, the portmanteauing of features is proposed. The portmanteau feature, inspired by the portmanteau word, is a feature containing information from both the original text image and the rectified image. To generate the portmanteau feature, a non-linear input pipeline with a block matrix initialization is presented. In this work, the transformer is chosen as the recognition network due to its utilization of attention and inherent parallelism, which can effectively handle the portmanteau feature. The proposed method is examined on 6 benchmarks and compared with 13 state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on various of the benchmarks.

 - **Abstract**
 Large language models (LLMs) have been shown to be able to perform new tasks based on a few demonstrations or natural language instructions. While these capabilities have led to widespread adoption, most LLMs are developed by resource-rich organizations and are frequently kept from the public. As a step towards democratizing this powerful technology, we present BLOOM, a 176B-parameter open-access language model designed and built thanks to a collaboration of hundreds of researchers. BLOOM is a decoder-only Transformer language model that was trained on the ROOTS corpus, a dataset comprising hundreds of sources in 46 natural and 13 programming languages (59 in total). We find that BLOOM achieves competitive performance on a wide variety of benchmarks, with stronger results after undergoing multitask prompted finetuning. To facilitate future research and applications using LLMs, we publicly release our models and code under the Responsible AI License.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the problem of efficient generative inference for Transformer models, in one of its most challenging settings: large deep models, with tight latency targets and long sequence lengths. Better understanding of the engineering tradeoffs for inference for large Transformer-based models is important as use cases of these models are growing rapidly throughout application areas. We develop a simple analytical model for inference efficiency to select the best multi-dimensional partitioning techniques optimized for TPU v4 slices based on the application requirements. We combine these with a suite of low-level optimizations to achieve a new Pareto frontier on the latency and model FLOPS utilization (MFU) tradeoffs on 500B+ parameter models that outperforms the FasterTransformer suite of benchmarks. We further show that with appropriate partitioning, the lower memory requirements of multiquery attention (i.e. multiple query heads share single key/value head) enables scaling up to 32x larger context lengths. Finally, we achieve a low-batch-size latency of 29ms per token during generation (using int8 weight quantization) and a 76% MFU during large-batch-size processing of input tokens, while supporting a long 2048-token context length on the PaLM 540B parameter model.

 - **Abstract**
 Vision Transformer (ViT) has emerged as a competitive alternative to convolutional neural networks for various computer vision applications. Specifically, ViT multi-head attention layers make it possible to embed information globally across the overall image. Nevertheless, computing and storing such attention matrices incurs a quadratic cost dependency on the number of patches, limiting its achievable efficiency and scalability and prohibiting more extensive real-world ViT applications on resource-constrained devices. Sparse attention has been shown to be a promising direction for improving hardware acceleration efficiency for NLP models. However, a systematic counterpart approach is still missing for accelerating ViT models. To close the above gap, we propose a first-of-its-kind algorithm-hardware codesigned framework, dubbed ViTALiTy, for boosting the inference efficiency of ViTs. Unlike sparsity-based Transformer accelerators for NLP, ViTALiTy unifies both low-rank and sparse components of the attention in ViTs. At the algorithm level, we approximate the dot-product softmax operation via first-order Taylor attention with row-mean centering as the low-rank component to linearize the cost of attention blocks and further boost the accuracy by incorporating a sparsity-based regularization. At the hardware level, we develop a dedicated accelerator to better leverage the resulting workload and pipeline from ViTALiTy's linear Taylor attention which requires the execution of only the low-rank component, to further boost the hardware efficiency. Extensive experiments and ablation studies validate that ViTALiTy offers boosted end-to-end efficiency (e.g., $3\times$ faster and $3\times$ energy-efficient) under comparable accuracy, with respect to the state-of-the-art solution.

 - **Abstract**
 Autonomous driving requires efficient reasoning about the location and appearance of the different agents in the scene, which aids in downstream tasks such as object detection, object tracking, and path planning. The past few years have witnessed a surge in approaches that combine the different taskbased modules of the classic self-driving stack into an End-toEnd(E2E) trainable learning system. These approaches replace perception, prediction, and sensor fusion modules with a single contiguous module with shared latent space embedding, from which one extracts a human-interpretable representation of the scene. One of the most popular representations is the Birds-eye View (BEV), which expresses the location of different traffic participants in the ego vehicle frame from a top-down view. However, a BEV does not capture the chromatic appearance information of the participants. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel representation that captures various traffic participants appearance and occupancy information from an array of monocular cameras covering 360 deg field of view (FOV). We use a learned image embedding of all camera images to generate a BEV of the scene at any instant that captures both appearance and occupancy of the scene, which can aid in downstream tasks such as object tracking and executing language-based commands. We test the efficacy of our approach on synthetic dataset generated from CARLA. The code, data set, and results can be found at https://rebrand.ly/APP OCC-results.
