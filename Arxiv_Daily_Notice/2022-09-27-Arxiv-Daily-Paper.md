 - **Abstract**
 In Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), Loop Closure Detection (LCD) is essential to minimize drift when recognizing previously visited places. Visual Bag-of-Words (vBoW) has been an LCD algorithm of choice for many state-of-the-art SLAM systems. It uses a set of visual features to provide robust place recognition but fails to perceive the semantics or spatial relationship between feature points. Previous work has mainly focused on addressing these issues by combining vBoW with semantic and spatial information from objects in the scene. However, they are unable to exploit spatial information of local visual features and lack a structure that unifies semantic objects and visual features, therefore limiting the symbiosis between the two components. This paper proposes SymbioLCD2, which creates a unified graph structure to integrate semantic objects and visual features symbiotically. Our novel graph-based LCD system utilizes the unified graph structure by applying a Weisfeiler-Lehman graph kernel with temporal constraints to robustly predict loop closure candidates. Evaluation of the proposed system shows that having a unified graph structure incorporating semantic objects and visual features improves LCD prediction accuracy, illustrating that the proposed graph structure provides a strong symbiosis between these two complementary components. It also outperforms other Machine Learning algorithms - such as SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Neural Network and GNN based Graph Matching Networks. Furthermore, it has shown good performance in detecting loop closure candidates earlier than state-of-the-art SLAM systems, demonstrating that extended semantic and spatial awareness from the unified graph structure significantly impacts LCD performance.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper addresses the Multi-Robot Active Information Acquisition (AIA) problem, where a team of mobile robots, communicating through an underlying graph, estimates a hidden state expressing a phenomenon of interest. Applications like target tracking, coverage and SLAM can be expressed in this framework. Existing approaches, though, are either not scalable, unable to handle dynamic phenomena or not robust to changes in the communication graph. To counter these shortcomings, we propose an Information-aware Graph Block Network (I-GBNet), an AIA adaptation of Graph Neural Networks, that aggregates information over the graph representation and provides sequential-decision making in a distributed manner. The I-GBNet, trained via imitation learning with a centralized sampling-based expert solver, exhibits permutation equivariance and time invariance, while harnessing the superior scalability, robustness and generalizability to previously unseen environments and robot configurations. Experiments on significantly larger graphs and dimensionality of the hidden state and more complex environments than those seen in training validate the properties of the proposed architecture and its efficacy in the application of localization and tracking of dynamic targets.

 - **Abstract**
 Cross-view geolocalization, a supplement or replacement for GPS, localizes an agent within a search area by matching images taken from a ground-view camera to overhead images taken from satellites or aircraft. Although the viewpoint disparity between ground and overhead images makes cross-view geolocalization challenging, significant progress has been made assuming that the ground agent has access to a panoramic camera. For example, our prior work (WAG) introduced changes in search area discretization, training loss, and particle filter weighting that enabled city-scale panoramic cross-view geolocalization. However, panoramic cameras are not widely used in existing robotic platforms due to their complexity and cost. Non-panoramic cross-view geolocalization is more applicable for robotics, but is also more challenging. This paper presents Restricted FOV Wide-Area Geolocalization (ReWAG), a cross-view geolocalization approach that generalizes WAG for use with standard, non-panoramic ground cameras by creating pose-aware embeddings and providing a strategy to incorporate particle pose into the Siamese network. ReWAG is a neural network and particle filter system that is able to globally localize a mobile agent in a GPS-denied environment with only odometry and a 90 degree FOV camera, achieving similar localization accuracy as what WAG achieved with a panoramic camera and improving localization accuracy by a factor of 100 compared to a baseline vision transformer (ViT) approach. A video highlight that demonstrates ReWAG's convergence on a test path of several dozen kilometers is available at https://youtu.be/U_OBQrt8qCE.

 - **Abstract**
 Event cameras are motion-activated sensors that capture pixel-level illumination changes instead of the intensity image with a fixed frame rate. Compared with the standard cameras, it can provide reliable visual perception during high-speed motions and in high dynamic range scenarios. However, event cameras output only a little information or even noise when the relative motion between the camera and the scene is limited, such as in a still state. While standard cameras can provide rich perception information in most scenarios, especially in good lighting conditions. These two cameras are exactly complementary. In this paper, we proposed a robust, high-accurate, and real-time optimization-based monocular event-based visual-inertial odometry (VIO) method with event-corner features, line-based event features, and point-based image features. The proposed method offers to leverage the point-based features in the nature scene and line-based features in the human-made scene to provide more additional structure or constraints information through well-design feature management. Experiments in the public benchmark datasets show that our method can achieve superior performance compared with the state-of-the-art image-based or event-based VIO. Finally, we used our method to demonstrate an onboard closed-loop autonomous quadrotor flight and large-scale outdoor experiments.

 - **Abstract**
 Scan undistortion is a key module for LiDAR odometry in high dynamic environment with high rotation and translation speed. The existing line of studies mostly focuses on one pass undistortion, which means undistortion for each point is conducted only once in the whole LiDAR-IMU odometry pipeline. In this paper, we propose an optimization based tightly coupled LiDAR-IMU odometry addressing iterated point-level undistortion. By jointly minimizing the cost derived from LiDAR and IMU measurements, our LiDAR-IMU odometry method performs more accurate and robust in high dynamic environment. Besides, the method characters good computation efficiency by limiting the quantity of parameters.

 Loop closure detection is a key technology for long-term robot navigation in complex environments.

 - **Abstract**
 3D flash LIDAR is an alternative to the traditional scanning LIDAR systems, promising precise depth imaging in a compact form factor, and free of moving parts, for applications such as self-driving cars, robotics and augmented reality (AR). Typically implemented using single-photon, direct time-of-flight (dToF) receivers in image sensor format, the operation of the devices can be hindered by the large number of photon events needing to be processed and compressed in outdoor scenarios, limiting frame rates and scalability to larger arrays. We here present a 64x32 pixel (256x128 SPAD) dToF imager that overcomes these limitations by using pixels with embedded histogramming, which lock onto and track the return signal. This reduces the size of output data frames considerably, enabling maximum frame rates in the 10 kFPS range or 100 kFPS for direct depth readings. The sensor offers selective readout of pixels detecting surfaces, or those sensing motion, leading to reduced power consumption and off-chip processing requirements. We demonstrate the application of the sensor in mid-range LIDAR.

 - **Abstract**
 Reconstructing an accurate and consistent large-scale LiDAR point cloud map is crucial for robotics applications. The existing solution, pose graph optimization, though it is time-efficient, does not directly optimize the mapping consistency. LiDAR bundle adjustment (BA) has been recently proposed to resolve this issue; however, it is too time-consuming on large-scale maps. To mitigate this problem, this paper presents a globally consistent and efficient mapping method suitable for large-scale maps. Our proposed work consists of a bottom-up hierarchical BA and a top-down pose graph optimization, which combines the advantages of both methods. With the hierarchical design, we solve multiple BA problems with a much smaller Hessian matrix size than the original BA; with the pose graph optimization, we smoothly and efficiently update the LiDAR poses. The effectiveness and robustness of our proposed approach have been validated on multiple spatially and timely large-scale public spinning LiDAR datasets, i.e., KITTI, MulRan and Newer College, and self-collected solid-state LiDAR datasets under structured and unstructured scenes. With proper setups, we demonstrate our work could generate a globally consistent map with around 12% of the sequence time.

 - **Abstract**
 LiDAR and cameras are two complementary sensors for 3D perception in autonomous driving. LiDAR point clouds have accurate spatial and geometry information, while RGB images provide textural and color data for context reasoning. To exploit LiDAR and cameras jointly, existing fusion methods tend to align each 3D point to only one projected image pixel based on calibration, namely one-to-one mapping. However, the performance of these approaches highly relies on the calibration quality, which is sensitive to the temporal and spatial synchronization of sensors. Therefore, we propose a Dynamic Cross Attention (DCA) module with a novel one-to-many cross-modality mapping that learns multiple offsets from the initial projection towards the neighborhood and thus develops tolerance to calibration error. Moreover, a \textit{dynamic query enhancement} is proposed to perceive the model-independent calibration, which further strengthens DCA's tolerance to the initial misalignment. The whole fusion architecture named Dynamic Cross Attention Network (DCAN) exploits multi-level image features and adapts to multiple representations of point clouds, which allows DCA to serve as a plug-in fusion module. Extensive experiments on nuScenes and KITTI prove DCA's effectiveness. The proposed DCAN outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the nuScenes detection challenge.

 - **Abstract**
 Recently, multi-sensors fusion has achieved significant progress in the field of automobility to improve navigation and position performance. As the prerequisite of the fusion algorithm, the demand for the extrinsic calibration of multi-sensors is growing. To calculate the extrinsic parameter, many researches have been dedicated to the two-step method, which integrates the respective calibration in pairs. It is inefficient and incompact because of losing sight of the constrain of all sensors. With regard to remove this burden, an optimization-based IMU/Lidar/Camera co-calibration method is proposed in the paper. Firstly, the IMU/camera and IMU/lidar online calibrations are conducted, respectively. Then, the corner and surface feature points in the chessboard are associated with the coarse result and the camera/lidar constraint is constructed. Finally, construct the co-calibration optimization to refine all extrinsic parameters. We evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme in simulation and the result demonstrates that our proposed method outperforms the two-step method.

 - **Abstract**
 Smart monitoring using three-dimensional (3D) image sensors has been attracting attention in the context of smart cities. In smart monitoring, object detection from point cloud data acquired by 3D image sensors is implemented for detecting moving objects such as vehicles and pedestrians to ensure safety on the road. However, the features of point cloud data are diversified due to the characteristics of light detection and ranging (LIDAR) units used as 3D image sensors or the install position of the 3D image sensors. Although a variety of deep learning (DL) models for object detection from point cloud data have been studied to date, no research has considered how to use multiple DL models in accordance with the features of the point cloud data. In this work, we propose a feature-based model selection framework that creates various DL models by using multiple DL methods and by utilizing training data with pseudo incompleteness generated by two artificial techniques: sampling and noise adding. It selects the most suitable DL model for the object detection task in accordance with the features of the point cloud data acquired in the real environment. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, we compare the performance of multiple DL models using benchmark datasets created from the KITTI dataset and present example results of object detection obtained through a real outdoor experiment. Depending on the situation, the detection accuracy varies up to 32% between DL models, which confirms the importance of selecting an appropriate DL model according to the situation.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we present a novel global descriptor termed stable triangle descriptor (STD) for 3D place recognition. For a triangle, its shape is uniquely determined by the length of the sides or included angles. Moreover, the shape of triangles is completely invariant to rigid transformations. Based on this property, we first design an algorithm to efficiently extract local key points from the 3D point cloud and encode these key points into triangular descriptors. Then, place recognition is achieved by matching the side lengths (and some other information) of the descriptors between point clouds. The point correspondence obtained from the descriptor matching pair can be further used in geometric verification, which greatly improves the accuracy of place recognition. In our experiments, we extensively compare our proposed system against other state-of-the-art systems (i.e., M2DP, Scan Context) on public datasets (i.e., KITTI, NCLT, and Complex-Urban) and our self-collected dataset (with a non-repetitive scanning solid-state LiDAR). All the quantitative results show that STD has stronger adaptability and a great improvement in precision over its counterparts. To share our findings and make contributions to the community, we open source our code on our GitHub: https://github.com/hku-mars/STD.

 - **Abstract**
 The non-uniform distribution and extremely sparse nature of the LiDAR point cloud (LPC) bring significant challenges to its high-efficient compression. This paper proposes a novel end-to-end, fully-factorized deep framework that encodes the original LPC into an octree structure and hierarchically decomposes the octree entropy model in layers. The proposed framework utilizes a hierarchical latent variable as side information to encapsulate the sibling and ancestor dependence, which provides sufficient context information for the modelling of point cloud distribution while enabling the parallel encoding and decoding of octree nodes in the same layer. Besides, we propose a residual coding framework for the compression of the latent variable, which explores the spatial correlation of each layer by progressive downsampling, and model the corresponding residual with a fully-factorized entropy model. Furthermore, we propose soft addition and subtraction for residual coding to improve network flexibility. The comprehensive experiment results on the LiDAR benchmark SemanticKITTI and MPEG-specified dataset Ford demonstrates that our proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance among all the previous LPC frameworks. Besides, our end-to-end, fully-factorized framework is proved by experiment to be high-parallelized and time-efficient and saves more than 99.8% of decoding time compared to previous state-of-the-art methods on LPC compression.

 - **Abstract**
 We propose DeepFusion, a modular multi-modal architecture to fuse lidars, cameras and radars in different combinations for 3D object detection. Specialized feature extractors take advantage of each modality and can be exchanged easily, making the approach simple and flexible. Extracted features are transformed into bird's-eye-view as a common representation for fusion. Spatial and semantic alignment is performed prior to fusing modalities in the feature space. Finally, a detection head exploits rich multi-modal features for improved 3D detection performance. Experimental results for lidar-camera, lidar-camera-radar and camera-radar fusion show the flexibility and effectiveness of our fusion approach. In the process, we study the largely unexplored task of faraway car detection up to 225~meters, showing the benefits of our lidar-camera fusion. Furthermore, we investigate the required density of lidar points for 3D object detection and illustrate implications at the example of robustness against adverse weather conditions. Moreover, ablation studies on our camera-radar fusion highlight the importance of accurate depth estimation.

 - **Abstract**
 Multi-agent collaborative perception could significantly upgrade the perception performance by enabling agents to share complementary information with each other through communication. It inevitably results in a fundamental trade-off between perception performance and communication bandwidth. To tackle this bottleneck issue, we propose a spatial confidence map, which reflects the spatial heterogeneity of perceptual information. It empowers agents to only share spatially sparse, yet perceptually critical information, contributing to where to communicate. Based on this novel spatial confidence map, we propose Where2comm, a communication-efficient collaborative perception framework. Where2comm has two distinct advantages: i) it considers pragmatic compression and uses less communication to achieve higher perception performance by focusing on perceptually critical areas; and ii) it can handle varying communication bandwidth by dynamically adjusting spatial areas involved in communication. To evaluate Where2comm, we consider 3D object detection in both real-world and simulation scenarios with two modalities (camera/LiDAR) and two agent types (cars/drones) on four datasets: OPV2V, V2X-Sim, DAIR-V2X, and our original CoPerception-UAVs. Where2comm consistently outperforms previous methods; for example, it achieves more than $100,000 \times$ lower communication volume and still outperforms DiscoNet and V2X-ViT on OPV2V. Our code is available at https://github.com/MediaBrain-SJTU/where2comm.

 - **Abstract**
 Leveraging multi-modal fusion, especially between camera and LiDAR, has become essential for building accurate and robust 3D object detection systems for autonomous vehicles. Until recently, point decorating approaches, in which point clouds are augmented with camera features, have been the dominant approach in the field. However, these approaches fail to utilize the higher resolution images from cameras. Recent works projecting camera features to the bird's-eye-view (BEV) space for fusion have also been proposed, however they require projecting millions of pixels, most of which only contain background information. In this work, we propose a novel approach Center Feature Fusion (CFF), in which we leverage center-based detection networks in both the camera and LiDAR streams to identify relevant object locations. We then use the center-based detection to identify the locations of pixel features relevant to object locations, a small fraction of the total number in the image. These are then projected and fused in the BEV frame. On the nuScenes dataset, we outperform the LiDAR-only baseline by 4.9% mAP while fusing up to 100x fewer features than other fusion methods.

 - **Abstract**
 Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have been successfully used for scene representation. Recent works have also developed robotic navigation and manipulation systems using NeRF-based environment representations. As object localization is the foundation for many robotic applications, to further unleash the potential of NeRFs in robotic systems, we study object localization within a NeRF scene. We propose a transformer-based framework NeRF-Loc to extract 3D bounding boxes of objects in NeRF scenes. NeRF-Loc takes a pre-trained NeRF model and camera view as input, and produces labeled 3D bounding boxes of objects as output. Concretely, we design a pair of paralleled transformer encoder branches, namely the coarse stream and the fine stream, to encode both the context and details of target objects. The encoded features are then fused together with attention layers to alleviate ambiguities for accurate object localization. We have compared our method with the conventional transformer-based method and our method achieves better performance. In addition, we also present the first NeRF samples-based object localization benchmark NeRFLocBench.

 - **Abstract**
 To navigate complex environments, robots must increasingly use high-dimensional visual feedback (e.g. images) for control. However, relying on high-dimensional image data to make control decisions raises important questions; particularly, how might we prove the safety of a visual-feedback controller? Control barrier functions (CBFs) are powerful tools for certifying the safety of feedback controllers in the state-feedback setting, but CBFs have traditionally been poorly-suited to visual feedback control due to the need to predict future observations in order to evaluate the barrier function. In this work, we solve this issue by leveraging recent advances in neural radiance fields (NeRFs), which learn implicit representations of 3D scenes and can render images from previously-unseen camera perspectives, to provide single-step visual foresight for a CBF-based controller. This novel combination is able to filter out unsafe actions and intervene to preserve safety. We demonstrate the effect of our controller in real-time simulation experiments where it successfully prevents the robot from taking dangerous actions.

 - **Abstract**
 Methods have recently been proposed that densely segment 3D volumes into classes using only color images and expert supervision in the form of sparse semantically annotated pixels. While impressive, these methods still require a relatively large amount of supervision and segmenting an object can take several minutes in practice. Such systems typically only optimize their representation on the particular scene they are fitting, without leveraging any prior information from previously seen images. In this paper, we propose to use features extracted with models trained on large existing datasets to improve segmentation performance. We bake this feature representation into a Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) by volumetrically rendering feature maps and supervising on features extracted from each input image. We show that by baking this representation into the NeRF, we make the subsequent classification task much easier. Our experiments show that our method achieves higher segmentation accuracy with fewer semantic annotations than existing methods over a wide range of scenes.

 - **Abstract**
 In Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), Loop Closure Detection (LCD) is essential to minimize drift when recognizing previously visited places. Visual Bag-of-Words (vBoW) has been an LCD algorithm of choice for many state-of-the-art SLAM systems. It uses a set of visual features to provide robust place recognition but fails to perceive the semantics or spatial relationship between feature points. Previous work has mainly focused on addressing these issues by combining vBoW with semantic and spatial information from objects in the scene. However, they are unable to exploit spatial information of local visual features and lack a structure that unifies semantic objects and visual features, therefore limiting the symbiosis between the two components. This paper proposes SymbioLCD2, which creates a unified graph structure to integrate semantic objects and visual features symbiotically. Our novel graph-based LCD system utilizes the unified graph structure by applying a Weisfeiler-Lehman graph kernel with temporal constraints to robustly predict loop closure candidates. Evaluation of the proposed system shows that having a unified graph structure incorporating semantic objects and visual features improves LCD prediction accuracy, illustrating that the proposed graph structure provides a strong symbiosis between these two complementary components. It also outperforms other Machine Learning algorithms - such as SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Neural Network and GNN based Graph Matching Networks. Furthermore, it has shown good performance in detecting loop closure candidates earlier than state-of-the-art SLAM systems, demonstrating that extended semantic and spatial awareness from the unified graph structure significantly impacts LCD performance.

 - **Abstract**
 Reconstructing an accurate and consistent large-scale LiDAR point cloud map is crucial for robotics applications. The existing solution, pose graph optimization, though it is time-efficient, does not directly optimize the mapping consistency. LiDAR bundle adjustment (BA) has been recently proposed to resolve this issue; however, it is too time-consuming on large-scale maps. To mitigate this problem, this paper presents a globally consistent and efficient mapping method suitable for large-scale maps. Our proposed work consists of a bottom-up hierarchical BA and a top-down pose graph optimization, which combines the advantages of both methods. With the hierarchical design, we solve multiple BA problems with a much smaller Hessian matrix size than the original BA; with the pose graph optimization, we smoothly and efficiently update the LiDAR poses. The effectiveness and robustness of our proposed approach have been validated on multiple spatially and timely large-scale public spinning LiDAR datasets, i.e., KITTI, MulRan and Newer College, and self-collected solid-state LiDAR datasets under structured and unstructured scenes. With proper setups, we demonstrate our work could generate a globally consistent map with around 12% of the sequence time.

 - **Abstract**
 Software development projects management is a complex endeavor because it requires dealing with numerous unforeseen events that constantly arise along the way and that go against the expectations that had been established at the beginning. A good project leader is not so much who carries out what is planned, but rather who is able to deal with all the inconveniences that arise and, in the end, achieve a result that is as close as possible to what was expected [1]. In other words, what is most valued is the ability to adapt to changes, to face unforeseen events, to make the best decisions regarding a reality that is imposed as the project progresses. On the other hand, those of us who dedicate ourselves to IT projects have the tendency to cling to the tools that gave us the best results, although many times they are not the most appropriate for the case or, if they are, we continue to maintain them even when the context of the project has changed. We are interested in portraying the state of the art of software development project management with respect to the selection of management strategies based on the complexity of the problem to be faced. Our goal is to collect all the available evidence, analyze it, and study the possibility of guiding in the selection of most appropriate approaches, techniques, and tools, depending on the complexity of the problem, to better manage projects. In this document we detail the planning phase of a Systematic Mapping Study, used to structure the findings on a research area, based on the guidelines from Petersen et al. Our goal is twofold: to identify the evidence present in the scientific literature about criteria to select agile or plan-based project management approaches, techniques and tools, and the frameworks used to characterize the projects, in case they are used. We will perform a systematic mapping study of the literature for this purpose.

 - **Abstract**
 We study how an autonomous agent learns to perform a task from demonstrations in a different domain, such as a different environment or different agent. Such cross-domain imitation learning is required to, for example, train an artificial agent from demonstrations of a human expert. We propose a scalable framework that enables cross-domain imitation learning without access to additional demonstrations or further domain knowledge. We jointly train the learner agent's policy and learn a mapping between the learner and expert domains with adversarial training. We effect this by using a mutual information criterion to find an embedding of the expert's state space that contains task-relevant information and is invariant to domain specifics. This step significantly simplifies estimating the mapping between the learner and expert domains and hence facilitates end-to-end learning. We demonstrate successful transfer of policies between considerably different domains, without extra supervision such as additional demonstrations, and in situations where other methods fail.

 - **Abstract**
 LiDAR and cameras are two complementary sensors for 3D perception in autonomous driving. LiDAR point clouds have accurate spatial and geometry information, while RGB images provide textural and color data for context reasoning. To exploit LiDAR and cameras jointly, existing fusion methods tend to align each 3D point to only one projected image pixel based on calibration, namely one-to-one mapping. However, the performance of these approaches highly relies on the calibration quality, which is sensitive to the temporal and spatial synchronization of sensors. Therefore, we propose a Dynamic Cross Attention (DCA) module with a novel one-to-many cross-modality mapping that learns multiple offsets from the initial projection towards the neighborhood and thus develops tolerance to calibration error. Moreover, a \textit{dynamic query enhancement} is proposed to perceive the model-independent calibration, which further strengthens DCA's tolerance to the initial misalignment. The whole fusion architecture named Dynamic Cross Attention Network (DCAN) exploits multi-level image features and adapts to multiple representations of point clouds, which allows DCA to serve as a plug-in fusion module. Extensive experiments on nuScenes and KITTI prove DCA's effectiveness. The proposed DCAN outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the nuScenes detection challenge.

 - **Abstract**
 Learning to optimize is a rapidly growing area that aims to solve optimization problems or improve existing optimization algorithms using machine learning (ML). In particular, the graph neural network (GNN) is considered a suitable ML model for optimization problems whose variables and constraints are permutation--invariant, for example, the linear program (LP). While the literature has reported encouraging numerical results, this paper establishes the theoretical foundation of applying GNNs to solving LPs. Given any size limit of LPs, we construct a GNN that maps different LPs to different outputs. We show that properly built GNNs can reliably predict feasibility, boundedness, and an optimal solution for each LP in a broad class. Our proofs are based upon the recently--discovered connections between the Weisfeiler--Lehman isomorphism test and the GNN. To validate our results, we train a simple GNN and present its accuracy in mapping LPs to their feasibilities and solutions.

 - **Abstract**
 In the study of subsurface seismic imaging, solving the acoustic wave equation is a pivotal component in existing models. With the advancement of deep learning, neural networks are applied to numerically solve partial differential equations by learning the mapping between the inputs and the solution of the equation, the wave equation in particular, since traditional methods can be time consuming if numerous instances are to be solved. Previous works that concentrate on solving the wave equation by neural networks consider either a single velocity model or multiple simple velocity models, which is restricted in practice. Therefore, inspired by the idea of operator learning, this work leverages the Fourier neural operator (FNO) to effectively learn the frequency domain seismic wavefields under the context of variable velocity models. Moreover, we propose a new framework paralleled Fourier neural operator (PFNO) for efficiently training the FNO-based solver given multiple source locations and frequencies. Numerical experiments demonstrate the high accuracy of both FNO and PFNO with complicated velocity models in the OpenFWI datasets. Furthermore, the cross-dataset generalization test verifies that PFNO adapts to out-of-distribution velocity models. Also, PFNO has robust performance in the presence of random noise in the labels. Finally, PFNO admits higher computational efficiency on large-scale testing datasets, compared with the traditional finite-difference method. The aforementioned advantages endow the FNO-based solver with the potential to build powerful models for research on seismic waves.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper proposes a method for learning continuous control policies for active landmark localization and exploration using an information-theoretic cost. We consider a mobile robot detecting landmarks within a limited sensing range, and tackle the problem of learning a control policy that maximizes the mutual information between the landmark states and the sensor observations. We employ a Kalman filter to convert the partially observable problem in the landmark state to Markov decision process (MDP), a differentiable field of view to shape the reward, and an attention-based neural network to represent the control policy. The approach is further unified with active volumetric mapping to promote exploration in addition to landmark localization. The performance is demonstrated in several simulated landmark localization tasks in comparison with benchmark methods.

 - **Abstract**
 Explanatory Interactive Learning (XIL) collects user feedback on visual model explanations to implement a Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) based interactive learning scenario. Different user feedback types will have different impacts on user experience and the cost associated with collecting feedback since different feedback types involve different levels of image annotation. Although XIL has been used to improve classification performance in multiple domains, the impact of different user feedback types on model performance and explanation accuracy is not well studied. To guide future XIL work we compare the effectiveness of two different user feedback types in image classification tasks: (1) instructing an algorithm to ignore certain spurious image features, and (2) instructing an algorithm to focus on certain valid image features. We use explanations from a Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (GradCAM) based XIL model to support both feedback types. We show that identifying and annotating spurious image features that a model finds salient results in superior classification and explanation accuracy than user feedback that tells a model to focus on valid image features.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a novel traffic trajectory editing method which uses spatio-temporal keyframes to control vehicles during the simulation to generate desired traffic trajectories. By taking self-motivation, path following and collision avoidance into account, the proposed force-based traffic simulation framework updates vehicle's motions in both the Frenet coordinates and the Cartesian coordinates. With the way-points from users, lane-level navigation can be generated by reference path planning. With a given keyframe, the coarse-to-fine optimization is proposed to efficiently generate the plausible trajectory which can satisfy the spatio-temporal constraints. At first, a directed state-time graph constructed along the reference path is used to search for a coarse-grained trajectory by mapping the keyframe as the goal. Then, using the information extracted from the coarse trajectory as initialization, adjoint-based optimization is applied to generate a finer trajectory with smooth motions based on our force-based simulation. We validate our method with extensive experiments.

 - **Abstract**
 Loop closure detection is a key technology for long-term robot navigation in complex environments. In this paper, we present a global descriptor, named Normal Distribution Descriptor (NDD), for 3D point cloud loop closure detection. The descriptor encodes both the probability density score and entropy of a point cloud as the descriptor. We also propose a fast rotation alignment process and use correlation coefficient as the similarity between descriptors. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art point cloud descriptors in both accuracy and efficency. The source code is available and can be integrated into existing LiDAR odometry and mapping (LOAM) systems.

 - **Abstract**
 The pace of reporting on Digital Twin (DT) projects continues to accelerate both in industry and academia. However, these experience reports often leave out essential characteristics of the DT, such as the scope of the system-under-study, the insights and actions enabled, and the time-scale of processing. A lack of these details could therefore hamper both understanding of these DTs and development of DT tools and techniques. Our previous work developed a DT description framework with fourteen characteristics as a checklist for experience report authors to better describe the capabilities of their DT projects. This report provides an extended example of reporting to highlight the utility of this description framework, focusing on the DT of an industrial drilling machine. Furthermore, we provide a mapping from our description framework to the Asset Administration Shell (AAS) which is an emerging standard for Industry 4.0 system integration. This mapping aids practitioners in understanding how our description framework relates to AAS, potentially aiding in description or implementation activities.

### Multi-Agent Exploration of an Unknown Sparse Landmark Complex via Deep  Reinforcement Learning

 - **Abstract**
 In recent years Landmark Complexes have been successfully employed for localization-free and metric-free autonomous exploration using a group of sensing-limited and communication-limited robots in a GPS-denied environment. To ensure rapid and complete exploration, existing works make assumptions on the density and distribution of landmarks in the environment. These assumptions may be overly restrictive, especially in hazardous environments where landmarks may be destroyed or completely missing. In this paper, we first propose a deep reinforcement learning framework for multi-agent cooperative exploration in environments with sparse landmarks while reducing client-server communication. By leveraging recent development on partial observability and credit assignment, our framework can train the exploration policy efficiently for multi-robot systems. The policy receives individual rewards from actions based on a proximity sensor with limited range and resolution, which is combined with group rewards to encourage collaborative exploration and construction of the Landmark Complex through observation of 0-, 1- and 2-dimensional simplices. In addition, we employ a three-stage curriculum learning strategy to mitigate the reward sparsity by gradually adding random obstacles and destroying random landmarks. Experiments in simulation demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art landmark complex exploration method in efficiency among different environments with sparse landmarks.

 - **Abstract**
 Cross-view geolocalization, a supplement or replacement for GPS, localizes an agent within a search area by matching images taken from a ground-view camera to overhead images taken from satellites or aircraft. Although the viewpoint disparity between ground and overhead images makes cross-view geolocalization challenging, significant progress has been made assuming that the ground agent has access to a panoramic camera. For example, our prior work (WAG) introduced changes in search area discretization, training loss, and particle filter weighting that enabled city-scale panoramic cross-view geolocalization. However, panoramic cameras are not widely used in existing robotic platforms due to their complexity and cost. Non-panoramic cross-view geolocalization is more applicable for robotics, but is also more challenging. This paper presents Restricted FOV Wide-Area Geolocalization (ReWAG), a cross-view geolocalization approach that generalizes WAG for use with standard, non-panoramic ground cameras by creating pose-aware embeddings and providing a strategy to incorporate particle pose into the Siamese network. ReWAG is a neural network and particle filter system that is able to globally localize a mobile agent in a GPS-denied environment with only odometry and a 90 degree FOV camera, achieving similar localization accuracy as what WAG achieved with a panoramic camera and improving localization accuracy by a factor of 100 compared to a baseline vision transformer (ViT) approach. A video highlight that demonstrates ReWAG's convergence on a test path of several dozen kilometers is available at https://youtu.be/U_OBQrt8qCE.

 - **Abstract**
 In Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), Loop Closure Detection (LCD) is essential to minimize drift when recognizing previously visited places. Visual Bag-of-Words (vBoW) has been an LCD algorithm of choice for many state-of-the-art SLAM systems. It uses a set of visual features to provide robust place recognition but fails to perceive the semantics or spatial relationship between feature points. Previous work has mainly focused on addressing these issues by combining vBoW with semantic and spatial information from objects in the scene. However, they are unable to exploit spatial information of local visual features and lack a structure that unifies semantic objects and visual features, therefore limiting the symbiosis between the two components. This paper proposes SymbioLCD2, which creates a unified graph structure to integrate semantic objects and visual features symbiotically. Our novel graph-based LCD system utilizes the unified graph structure by applying a Weisfeiler-Lehman graph kernel with temporal constraints to robustly predict loop closure candidates. Evaluation of the proposed system shows that having a unified graph structure incorporating semantic objects and visual features improves LCD prediction accuracy, illustrating that the proposed graph structure provides a strong symbiosis between these two complementary components. It also outperforms other Machine Learning algorithms - such as SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Neural Network and GNN based Graph Matching Networks. Furthermore, it has shown good performance in detecting loop closure candidates earlier than state-of-the-art SLAM systems, demonstrating that extended semantic and spatial awareness from the unified graph structure significantly impacts LCD performance.

 Robot localization is an inverse problem of finding a robot's pose using a map and sensor measurements. In recent years, Invertible Neural Networks (INNs) have successfully solved ambiguous inverse problems in various fields. This paper proposes a framework that solves the localization problem with INN. We design an INN that provides implicit map representation in the forward path and localization in the inverse path. By sampling the latent space in evaluation, Local\_INN outputs robot poses with covariance, which can be used to estimate the uncertainty. We show that the localization performance of Local\_INN is on par with current methods with much lower latency. We show detailed 2D and 3D map reconstruction from Local\_INN using poses exterior to the training set. We also provide a global localization algorithm using Local\_INN to tackle the kidnapping problem.

 - **Abstract**
 Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have been successfully used for scene representation. Recent works have also developed robotic navigation and manipulation systems using NeRF-based environment representations. As object localization is the foundation for many robotic applications, to further unleash the potential of NeRFs in robotic systems, we study object localization within a NeRF scene. We propose a transformer-based framework NeRF-Loc to extract 3D bounding boxes of objects in NeRF scenes. NeRF-Loc takes a pre-trained NeRF model and camera view as input, and produces labeled 3D bounding boxes of objects as output. Concretely, we design a pair of paralleled transformer encoder branches, namely the coarse stream and the fine stream, to encode both the context and details of target objects. The encoded features are then fused together with attention layers to alleviate ambiguities for accurate object localization. We have compared our method with the conventional transformer-based method and our method achieves better performance. In addition, we also present the first NeRF samples-based object localization benchmark NeRFLocBench.

 - **Abstract**
 Distinguishing if an action is performed as intended or if an intended action fails is an important skill that not only humans have, but that is also important for intelligent systems that operate in human environments. Recognizing if an action is unintentional or anticipating if an action will fail, however, is not straightforward due to lack of annotated data. While videos of unintentional or failed actions can be found in the Internet in abundance, high annotation costs are a major bottleneck for learning networks for these tasks. In this work, we thus study the problem of self-supervised representation learning for unintentional action prediction. While previous works learn the representation based on a local temporal neighborhood, we show that the global context of a video is needed to learn a good representation for the three downstream tasks: unintentional action classification, localization and anticipation. In the supplementary material, we show that the learned representation can be used for detecting anomalies in videos as well.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper addresses the Multi-Robot Active Information Acquisition (AIA) problem, where a team of mobile robots, communicating through an underlying graph, estimates a hidden state expressing a phenomenon of interest. Applications like target tracking, coverage and SLAM can be expressed in this framework. Existing approaches, though, are either not scalable, unable to handle dynamic phenomena or not robust to changes in the communication graph. To counter these shortcomings, we propose an Information-aware Graph Block Network (I-GBNet), an AIA adaptation of Graph Neural Networks, that aggregates information over the graph representation and provides sequential-decision making in a distributed manner. The I-GBNet, trained via imitation learning with a centralized sampling-based expert solver, exhibits permutation equivariance and time invariance, while harnessing the superior scalability, robustness and generalizability to previously unseen environments and robot configurations. Experiments on significantly larger graphs and dimensionality of the hidden state and more complex environments than those seen in training validate the properties of the proposed architecture and its efficacy in the application of localization and tracking of dynamic targets.

 The paper addresses the problem of multi-agent communication in networks with regular directed ring structure. These can be viewed as hierarchical extensions of the classical cyclic pursuit topology. We show that the spectra of the corresponding Laplacian matrices allow exact localization on the complex plane. Furthermore, we derive a general form of the characteristic polynomial of such matrices, analyze the algebraic curves its roots belong to, and propose a way to obtain their closed-form equations. In combination with frequency domain consensus criteria for high-order SISO linear agents, these curves enable one to analyze the feasibility of consensus in networks with varying number of agents.

 - **Abstract**
 Reconstruction method based on the memory module for visual anomaly detection attempts to narrow the reconstruction error for normal samples while enlarging it for anomalous samples. Unfortunately, the existing memory module is not fully applicable to the anomaly detection task, and the reconstruction error of the anomaly samples remains small. Towards this end, this work proposes a new unsupervised visual anomaly detection method to jointly learn effective normal features and eliminate unfavorable reconstruction errors. Specifically, a novel Partition Memory Bank (PMB) module is proposed to effectively learn and store detailed features with semantic integrity of normal samples. It develops a new partition mechanism and a unique query generation method to preserve the context information and then improves the learning ability of the memory module. The proposed PMB and the skip connection are alternatively explored to make the reconstruction of abnormal samples worse. To obtain more precise anomaly localization results and solve the problem of cumulative reconstruction error, a novel Histogram Error Estimation module is proposed to adaptively eliminate the unfavorable errors by the histogram of the difference image. It improves the anomaly localization performance without increasing the cost. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method for anomaly detection and localization, extensive experiments are conducted on three widely-used anomaly detection datasets. The encouraging performance of the proposed method compared to the recent approaches based on the memory module demonstrates its superiority.

 Chapter generation becomes practical technique for online videos nowadays. The chapter breakpoints enable users to quickly find the parts they want and get the summative annotations. However, there is no public method and dataset for this task. To facilitate the research along this direction, we introduce a new dataset called Chapter-Gen, which consists of approximately 10k user-generated videos with annotated chapter information. Our data collection procedure is fast, scalable and does not require any additional manual annotation. On top of this dataset, we design an effective baseline specificlly for video chapters generation task. which captures two aspects of a video,including visual dynamics and narration text. It disentangles local and global video features for localization and title generation respectively. To parse the long video efficiently, a skip sliding window mechanism is designed to localize potential chapters. And a cross attention multi-modal fusion module is developed to aggregate local features for title generation. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves superior results over existing methods which illustrate that the method design for similar task cannot be transfered directly even after fine-tuning. Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/czt117/MVCG.

 - **Abstract**
 Functional registration algorithms represent point clouds as functions (e.g. spacial occupancy field) avoiding unreliable correspondence estimation in conventional least-squares registration algorithms. However, existing functional registration algorithms are computationally expensive. Furthermore, the capability of registration with unknown scale is necessary in tasks such as CAD model-based object localization, yet no such support exists in functional registration. In this work, we propose a scale-invariant, linear time complexity functional registration algorithm. We achieve linear time complexity through an efficient approximation of L2-distance between functions using orthonormal basis functions. The use of orthonormal basis functions leads to a formulation that is compatible with least-squares registration. Benefited from the least-square formulation, we use the theory of translation-rotation-invariant measurement to decouple scale estimation and therefore achieve scale-invariant registration. We evaluate the proposed algorithm, named FLS (functional least-squares), on standard 3D registration benchmarks, showing FLS is an order of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art functional registration algorithm without compromising accuracy and robustness. FLS also outperforms state-of-the-art correspondence-based least-squares registration algorithm on accuracy and robustness, with known and unknown scale. Finally, we demonstrate applying FLS to register point clouds with varying densities and partial overlaps, point clouds from different objects within the same category, and point clouds from real world objects with noisy RGB-D measurements.

### Periodic Graph Transformers for Crystal Material Property Prediction

 - **Abstract**
 We consider representation learning on periodic graphs encoding crystal materials. Different from regular graphs, periodic graphs consist of a minimum unit cell repeating itself on a regular lattice in 3D space. How to effectively encode these periodic structures poses unique challenges not present in regular graph representation learning. In addition to being E(3) invariant, periodic graph representations need to be periodic invariant. That is, the learned representations should be invariant to shifts of cell boundaries as they are artificially imposed. Furthermore, the periodic repeating patterns need to be captured explicitly as lattices of different sizes and orientations may correspond to different materials. In this work, we propose a transformer architecture, known as Matformer, for periodic graph representation learning. Our Matformer is designed to be invariant to periodicity and can capture repeating patterns explicitly. In particular, Matformer encodes periodic patterns by efficient use of geometric distances between the same atoms in neighboring cells. Experimental results on multiple common benchmark datasets show that our Matformer outperforms baseline methods consistently. In addition, our results demonstrate the importance of periodic invariance and explicit repeating pattern encoding for crystal representation learning.

 - **Abstract**
 Session-based recommender systems (SBRSs) have shown superior performance over conventional methods. However, they show limited scalability on large-scale industrial datasets since most models learn one embedding per item. This leads to a large memory requirement (of storing one vector per item) and poor performance on sparse sessions with cold-start or unpopular items. Using one public and one large industrial dataset, we experimentally show that state-of-the-art SBRSs have low performance on sparse sessions with sparse items. We propose M2TRec, a Metadata-aware Multi-task Transformer model for session-based recommendations. Our proposed method learns a transformation function from item metadata to embeddings, and is thus, item-ID free (i.e., does not need to learn one embedding per item). It integrates item metadata to learn shared representations of diverse item attributes. During inference, new or unpopular items will be assigned identical representations for the attributes they share with items previously observed during training, and thus will have similar representations with those items, enabling recommendations of even cold-start and sparse items. Additionally, M2TRec is trained in a multi-task setting to predict the next item in the session along with its primary category and subcategories. Our multi-task strategy makes the model converge faster and significantly improves the overall performance. Experimental results show significant performance gains using our proposed approach on sparse items on the two datasets.

 - **Abstract**
 Automated question generation is an important approach to enable personalisation of English comprehension assessment. Recently, transformer-based pretrained language models have demonstrated the ability to produce appropriate questions from a context paragraph. Typically, these systems are evaluated against a reference set of manually generated questions using n-gram based metrics, or manual qualitative assessment. Here, we focus on a fully automated multiple-choice question generation (MCQG) system where both the question and possible answers must be generated from the context paragraph. Applying n-gram based approaches is challenging for this form of system as the reference set is unlikely to capture the full range of possible questions and answer options. Conversely manual assessment scales poorly and is expensive for MCQG system development. In this work, we propose a set of performance criteria that assess different aspects of the generated multiple-choice questions of interest. These qualities include: grammatical correctness, answerability, diversity and complexity. Initial systems for each of these metrics are described, and individually evaluated on standard multiple-choice reading comprehension corpora.

 - **Abstract**
 Cross-view geolocalization, a supplement or replacement for GPS, localizes an agent within a search area by matching images taken from a ground-view camera to overhead images taken from satellites or aircraft. Although the viewpoint disparity between ground and overhead images makes cross-view geolocalization challenging, significant progress has been made assuming that the ground agent has access to a panoramic camera. For example, our prior work (WAG) introduced changes in search area discretization, training loss, and particle filter weighting that enabled city-scale panoramic cross-view geolocalization. However, panoramic cameras are not widely used in existing robotic platforms due to their complexity and cost. Non-panoramic cross-view geolocalization is more applicable for robotics, but is also more challenging. This paper presents Restricted FOV Wide-Area Geolocalization (ReWAG), a cross-view geolocalization approach that generalizes WAG for use with standard, non-panoramic ground cameras by creating pose-aware embeddings and providing a strategy to incorporate particle pose into the Siamese network. ReWAG is a neural network and particle filter system that is able to globally localize a mobile agent in a GPS-denied environment with only odometry and a 90 degree FOV camera, achieving similar localization accuracy as what WAG achieved with a panoramic camera and improving localization accuracy by a factor of 100 compared to a baseline vision transformer (ViT) approach. A video highlight that demonstrates ReWAG's convergence on a test path of several dozen kilometers is available at https://youtu.be/U_OBQrt8qCE.

 - **Abstract**
 "Induction heads" are attention heads that implement a simple algorithm to complete token sequences like [A][B] ... [A] -> [B]. In this work, we present preliminary and indirect evidence for a hypothesis that induction heads might constitute the mechanism for the majority of all "in-context learning" in large transformer models (i.e. decreasing loss at increasing token indices). We find that induction heads develop at precisely the same point as a sudden sharp increase in in-context learning ability, visible as a bump in the training loss. We present six complementary lines of evidence, arguing that induction heads may be the mechanistic source of general in-context learning in transformer models of any size. For small attention-only models, we present strong, causal evidence; for larger models with MLPs, we present correlational evidence.

 In this paper, we present our solution to the MuSe-Humor sub-challenge of the Multimodal Emotional Challenge (MuSe) 2022. The goal of the MuSe-Humor sub-challenge is to detect humor and calculate AUC from audiovisual recordings of German football Bundesliga press conferences. It is annotated for humor displayed by the coaches. For this sub-challenge, we first build a discriminant model using the transformer module and BiLSTM module, and then propose a hybrid fusion strategy to use the prediction results of each modality to improve the performance of the model. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model and hybrid fusion strategy on multimodal fusion, and the AUC of our proposed model on the test set is 0.8972.

 - **Abstract**
 In hope of expanding training data, researchers often want to merge two or more datasets that are created using different labeling schemes. This paper considers two datasets that label part-of-speech (POS) tags under different tagging schemes and leverage the supervised labels of one dataset to help generate labels for the other dataset. This paper further discusses the theoretical difficulties of this approach and proposes a novel supervised architecture employing Transformers to tackle the problem of consolidating two completely disjoint datasets. The results diverge from initial expectations and discourage exploration into the use of disjoint labels to consolidate datasets with different labels.

 - **Abstract**
 Cyrillic and Traditional Mongolian are the two main members of the Mongolian writing system. The Cyrillic-Traditional Mongolian Bidirectional Conversion (CTMBC) task includes two conversion processes, including Cyrillic Mongolian to Traditional Mongolian (C2T) and Traditional Mongolian to Cyrillic Mongolian conversions (T2C). Previous researchers adopted the traditional joint sequence model, since the CTMBC task is a natural Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq) modeling problem. Recent studies have shown that Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and Self-attention (or Transformer) based encoder-decoder models have shown significant improvement in machine translation tasks between some major languages, such as Mandarin, English, French, etc. However, an open problem remains as to whether the CTMBC quality can be improved by utilizing the RNN and Transformer models. To answer this question, this paper investigates the utility of these two powerful techniques for CTMBC task combined with agglutinative characteristics of Mongolian language. We build the encoder-decoder based CTMBC model based on RNN and Transformer respectively and compare the different network configurations deeply. The experimental results show that both RNN and Transformer models outperform the traditional joint sequence model, where the Transformer achieves the best performance. Compared with the joint sequence baseline, the word error rate (WER) of the Transformer for C2T and T2C decreased by 5.72\% and 5.06\% respectively.

 - **Abstract**
 Dozens of new tools and technologies are being incorporated to help developers, which is becoming a source of consternation as they struggle to choose one over the others. For example, there are at least ten frameworks available to developers for developing web applications, posing a conundrum in selecting the best one that meets their needs. As a result, developers are continuously searching for all of the benefits and drawbacks of each API, framework, tool, and so on. One of the typical approaches is to examine all of the features through official documentation and discussion. This approach is time-consuming, often makes it difficult to determine which aspects are the most important to a particular developer and whether a particular aspect is important to the community at large. In this paper, we have used a benchmark API aspects dataset (Opiner) collected from StackOverflow posts and observed how Transformer models (BERT, RoBERTa, DistilBERT, and XLNet) perform in detecting software aspects in textual developer discussion with respect to the baseline Support Vector Machine (SVM) model. Through extensive experimentation, we have found that transformer models improve the performance of baseline SVM for most of the aspects, i.e., `Performance', `Security', `Usability', `Documentation', `Bug', `Legal', `OnlySentiment', and `Others'. However, the models fail to apprehend some of the aspects (e.g., `Community' and `Potability') and their performance varies depending on the aspects. Also, larger architectures like XLNet are ineffective in interpreting software aspects compared to smaller architectures like DistilBERT.

 - **Abstract**
 Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have been successfully used for scene representation. Recent works have also developed robotic navigation and manipulation systems using NeRF-based environment representations. As object localization is the foundation for many robotic applications, to further unleash the potential of NeRFs in robotic systems, we study object localization within a NeRF scene. We propose a transformer-based framework NeRF-Loc to extract 3D bounding boxes of objects in NeRF scenes. NeRF-Loc takes a pre-trained NeRF model and camera view as input, and produces labeled 3D bounding boxes of objects as output. Concretely, we design a pair of paralleled transformer encoder branches, namely the coarse stream and the fine stream, to encode both the context and details of target objects. The encoded features are then fused together with attention layers to alleviate ambiguities for accurate object localization. We have compared our method with the conventional transformer-based method and our method achieves better performance. In addition, we also present the first NeRF samples-based object localization benchmark NeRFLocBench.

 - **Abstract**
 Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated impressive capability in generating fluent text. LLMs have also shown an alarming tendency to reproduce social biases, for example stereotypical associations between gender and occupation or race and criminal behavior. Like race and gender, morality is an important social variable; our moral biases affect how we receive other people and their arguments. I anticipate that the apparent moral capabilities of LLMs will play an important role in their effects on the human social environment. This work investigates whether LLMs reproduce the moral biases associated with political groups, a capability I refer to as moral mimicry. I explore this hypothesis in GPT-3, a 175B-parameter language model based on the Transformer architecture, using tools from Moral Foundations Theory to measure the moral content in text generated by the model following prompting with liberal and conservative political identities. The results demonstrate that large language models are indeed moral mimics; when prompted with a political identity, GPT-3 generates text reflecting the corresponding moral biases. Moral mimicry could contribute to fostering understanding between social groups via moral reframing. Worryingly, it could also reinforce polarized views, exacerbating existing social challenges. I hope that this work encourages further investigation of the moral mimicry capability, including how to leverage it for social good and minimize its risks.

 Neural architecture search (NAS) for transformers has been used to create state-of-the-art models that target certain latency constraints. In this work we present Bigger&Faster, a novel quantization-aware parameter sharing NAS that finds architectures for 8-bit integer (int8) quantized transformers. Our results show that our method is able to produce BERT models that outperform the current state-of-the-art technique, AutoTinyBERT, at all latency targets we tested, achieving up to a 2.68% accuracy gain. Additionally, although the models found by our technique have a larger number of parameters than their float32 counterparts, due to their parameters being int8, they have significantly smaller memory footprints.

 - **Abstract**
 Anomaly detection has recently gained increasing attention in the field of computer vision, likely due to its broad set of applications ranging from product fault detection on industrial production lines and impending event detection in video surveillance to finding lesions in medical scans. Regardless of the domain, anomaly detection is typically framed as a one-class classification task, where the learning is conducted on normal examples only. An entire family of successful anomaly detection methods is based on learning to reconstruct masked normal inputs (e.g. patches, future frames, etc.) and exerting the magnitude of the reconstruction error as an indicator for the abnormality level. Unlike other reconstruction-based methods, we present a novel self-supervised masked convolutional transformer block (SSMCTB) that comprises the reconstruction-based functionality at a core architectural level. The proposed self-supervised block is extremely flexible, enabling information masking at any layer of a neural network and being compatible with a wide range of neural architectures. In this work, we extend our previous self-supervised predictive convolutional attentive block (SSPCAB) with a 3D masked convolutional layer, as well as a transformer for channel-wise attention. Furthermore, we show that our block is applicable to a wider variety of tasks, adding anomaly detection in medical images and thermal videos to the previously considered tasks based on RGB images and surveillance videos. We exhibit the generality and flexibility of SSMCTB by integrating it into multiple state-of-the-art neural models for anomaly detection, bringing forth empirical results that confirm considerable performance improvements on five benchmarks: MVTec AD, BRATS, Avenue, ShanghaiTech, and Thermal Rare Event. We release our code and data as open source at https://github.com/ristea/ssmctb.

 Vision transformers (ViT) have shown promise in various vision tasks including low-level ones while the U-Net remains dominant in score-based diffusion models. In this paper, we perform a systematical empirical study on the ViT-based architectures in diffusion models. Our results suggest that adding extra long skip connections (like the U-Net) to ViT is crucial to diffusion models. The new ViT architecture, together with other improvements, is referred to as U-ViT. On several popular visual datasets, U-ViT achieves competitive generation results to SOTA U-Net while requiring comparable amount of parameters and computation if not less.

 - **Abstract**
 Since radiology reports needed for clinical practice and research are written and stored in free-text narrations, extraction of relative information for further analysis is difficult. In these circumstances, natural language processing (NLP) techniques can facilitate automatic information extraction and transformation of free-text formats to structured data. In recent years, deep learning (DL)-based models have been adapted for NLP experiments with promising results. Despite the significant potential of DL models based on artificial neural networks (ANN) and convolutional neural networks (CNN), the models face some limitations to implement in clinical practice. Transformers, another new DL architecture, have been increasingly applied to improve the process. Therefore, in this study, we propose a transformer-based fine-grained named entity recognition (NER) architecture for clinical information extraction. We collected 88 abdominopelvic sonography reports in free-text formats and annotated them based on our developed information schema. The text-to-text transfer transformer model (T5) and Scifive, a pre-trained domain-specific adaptation of the T5 model, were applied for fine-tuning to extract entities and relations and transform the input into a structured format. Our transformer-based model in this study outperformed previously applied approaches such as ANN and CNN models based on ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, ROUGE-L, and BLEU scores of 0.816, 0.668, 0.528, and 0.743, respectively, while providing an interpretable structured report.

 - **Abstract**
 Modeling sparse and dense image matching within a unified functional correspondence model has recently attracted increasing research interest. However, existing efforts mainly focus on improving matching accuracy while ignoring its efficiency, which is crucial for realworld applications. In this paper, we propose an efficient structure named Efficient Correspondence Transformer (ECO-TR) by finding correspondences in a coarse-to-fine manner, which significantly improves the efficiency of functional correspondence model. To achieve this, multiple transformer blocks are stage-wisely connected to gradually refine the predicted coordinates upon a shared multi-scale feature extraction network. Given a pair of images and for arbitrary query coordinates, all the correspondences are predicted within a single feed-forward pass. We further propose an adaptive query-clustering strategy and an uncertainty-based outlier detection module to cooperate with the proposed framework for faster and better predictions. Experiments on various sparse and dense matching tasks demonstrate the superiority of our method in both efficiency and effectiveness against existing state-of-the-arts.

 - **Abstract**
 Hand hygiene is a standard six-step hand-washing action proposed by the World Health Organization (WHO). However, there is no good way to supervise medical staff to do hand hygiene, which brings the potential risk of disease spread. In this work, we propose a new computer vision task called hand hygiene assessment to provide intelligent supervision of hand hygiene for medical staff. Existing action assessment works usually make an overall quality prediction on an entire video. However, the internal structures of hand hygiene action are important in hand hygiene assessment. Therefore, we propose a novel fine-grained learning framework to perform step segmentation and key action scorer in a joint manner for accurate hand hygiene assessment. Existing temporal segmentation methods usually employ multi-stage convolutional network to improve the segmentation robustness, but easily lead to over-segmentation due to the lack of the long-range dependence. To address this issue, we design a multi-stage convolution-transformer network for step segmentation. Based on the observation that each hand-washing step involves several key actions which determine the hand-washing quality, we design a set of key action scorers to evaluate the quality of key actions in each step. In addition, there lacks a unified dataset in hand hygiene assessment. Therefore, under the supervision of medical staff, we contribute a video dataset that contains 300 video sequences with fine-grained annotations. Extensive experiments on the dataset suggest that our method well assesses hand hygiene videos and achieves outstanding performance.

 - **Abstract**
 Human trajectory forecasting in crowds presents the challenges of modelling social interactions and outputting collision-free multimodal distribution. Following the success of Social Generative Adversarial Networks (SGAN), recent works propose various GAN-based designs to better model human motion in crowds. Despite superior performance in reducing distance-based metrics, current networks fail to output socially acceptable trajectories, as evidenced by high collisions in model predictions. To counter this, we introduce SGANv2: an improved safety-compliant SGAN architecture equipped with spatio-temporal interaction modelling and a transformer-based discriminator. The spatio-temporal modelling ability helps to learn the human social interactions better while the transformer-based discriminator design improves temporal sequence modelling. Additionally, SGANv2 utilizes the learned discriminator even at test-time via a collaborative sampling strategy that not only refines the colliding trajectories but also prevents mode collapse, a common phenomenon in GAN training. Through extensive experimentation on multiple real-world and synthetic datasets, we demonstrate the efficacy of SGANv2 to provide socially-compliant multimodal trajectories.

 - **Abstract**
 Tracking multiple athletes in sports videos is a very challenging Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) task, since athletes often have the same appearance and are intimately covered with each other, making a common occlusion problem becomes an abhorrent duplicate detection. In this paper, the duplicate detection is newly and precisely defined as occlusion misreporting on the same athlete by multiple detection boxes in one frame. To address this problem, we meticulously design a novel transformer-based Duplicate Detection Decontaminator (D$^3$) for training, and a specific algorithm Rally-Hungarian (RH) for matching. Once duplicate detection occurs, D$^3$ immediately modifies the procedure by generating enhanced boxes losses. RH, triggered by the team sports substitution rules, is exceedingly suitable for sports videos. Moreover, to complement the tracking dataset that without shot changes, we release a new dataset based on sports video named RallyTrack. Extensive experiments on RallyTrack show that combining D$^3$ and RH can dramatically improve the tracking performance with 9.2 in MOTA and 4.5 in HOTA. Meanwhile, experiments on MOT-series and DanceTrack discover that D$^3$ can accelerate convergence during training, especially save up to 80 percent of the original training time on MOT17. Finally, our model, which is trained only with volleyball videos, can be applied directly to basketball and soccer videos for MAT, which shows priority of our method. Our dataset is available at https://github.com/heruihr/rallytrack.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we present a fast monocular depth estimation method for enabling 3D perception capabilities of low-cost underwater robots. We formulate a novel end-to-end deep visual learning pipeline named UDepth, which incorporates domain knowledge of image formation characteristics of natural underwater scenes. First, we adapt a new input space from raw RGB image space by exploiting underwater light attenuation prior, and then devise a least-squared formulation for coarse pixel-wise depth prediction. Subsequently, we extend this into a domain projection loss that guides the end-to-end learning of UDepth on over 9K RGB-D training samples. UDepth is designed with a computationally light MobileNetV2 backbone and a Transformer-based optimizer for ensuring fast inference rates on embedded systems. By domain-aware design choices and through comprehensive experimental analyses, we demonstrate that it is possible to achieve state-of-the-art depth estimation performance while ensuring a small computational footprint. Specifically, with 70%-80% less network parameters than existing benchmarks, UDepth achieves comparable and often better depth estimation performance. While the full model offers over 66 FPS (13 FPS) inference rates on a single GPU (CPU core), our domain projection for coarse depth prediction runs at 51.5 FPS rates on single-board NVIDIA Jetson TX2s. The inference pipelines are available at https://github.com/uf-robopi/UDepth.

 We study the task of robust feature representations, aiming to generalize well on multiple datasets for action recognition. We build our method on Transformers for its efficacy. Although we have witnessed great progress for video action recognition in the past decade, it remains challenging yet valuable how to train a single model that can perform well across multiple datasets. Here, we propose a novel multi-dataset training paradigm, MultiTrain, with the design of two new loss terms, namely informative loss and projection loss, aiming to learn robust representations for action recognition. In particular, the informative loss maximizes the expressiveness of the feature embedding while the projection loss for each dataset mines the intrinsic relations between classes across datasets. We verify the effectiveness of our method on five challenging datasets, Kinetics-400, Kinetics-700, Moments-in-Time, Activitynet and Something-something-v2 datasets. Extensive experimental results show that our method can consistently improve the state-of-the-art performance.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper examines the problem of optimizing the charging pattern of electric vehicles (EV) by taking real-time electricity grid carbon intensity into consideration. The objective of the proposed charging scheme is to minimize the carbon emissions contributed by EV charging events, while simultaneously satisfying constraints posed by EV user's charging schedules, charging station transformer limits, and battery physical constraints. Using real-world EV charging data and California electricity generation records, this paper shows that our carbon-aware real-time charging scheme saves an average of 3.81% of carbon emission while delivering satisfactory amount of energy. Furthermore, by using an adaptive balanced factor, we can reduce 26.00% of carbon emission on average while compromising 12.61% of total energy delivered.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we propose the Generalized Parametric Contrastive Learning (GPaCo/PaCo) which works well on both imbalanced and balanced data. Based on theoretical analysis, we observe that supervised contrastive loss tends to bias high-frequency classes and thus increases the difficulty of imbalanced learning. We introduce a set of parametric class-wise learnable centers to rebalance from an optimization perspective. Further, we analyze our GPaCo/PaCo loss under a balanced setting. Our analysis demonstrates that GPaCo/PaCo can adaptively enhance the intensity of pushing samples of the same class close as more samples are pulled together with their corresponding centers and benefit hard example learning. Experiments on long-tailed benchmarks manifest the new state-of-the-art for long-tailed recognition. On full ImageNet, models from CNNs to vision transformers trained with GPaCo loss show better generalization performance and stronger robustness compared with MAE models. Moreover, GPaCo can be applied to the semantic segmentation task and obvious improvements are observed on the 4 most popular benchmarks.

 - **Abstract**
 Language model (LM) pretraining has led to consistent improvements in many NLP downstream tasks, including named entity recognition (NER). In this paper, we present T-NER (Transformer-based Named Entity Recognition), a Python library for NER LM finetuning. In addition to its practical utility, T-NER facilitates the study and investigation of the cross-domain and cross-lingual generalization ability of LMs finetuned on NER. Our library also provides a web app where users can get model predictions interactively for arbitrary text, which facilitates qualitative model evaluation for non-expert programmers. We show the potential of the library by compiling nine public NER datasets into a unified format and evaluating the cross-domain and cross-lingual performance across the datasets. The results from our initial experiments show that in-domain performance is generally competitive across datasets. However, cross-domain generalization is challenging even with a large pretrained LM, which has nevertheless capacity to learn domain-specific features if fine-tuned on a combined dataset. To facilitate future research, we also release all our LM checkpoints via the Hugging Face model hub.

 - **Abstract**
 Modern NLP models are becoming better conversational agents than their predecessors. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and especially Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) features allow the agent to better store and use information about semantic content, a trend that has become even more pronounced with the Transformer Models. Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-3 by OpenAI have become known to be able to construct and follow a narrative, which enables the system to adopt personas on the go, adapt them and play along in conversational stories. However, practical experimentation with GPT-3 shows that there is a recurring problem with these modern NLP systems, namely that they can "get stuck" in the narrative so that further conversations, prompt executions or commands become futile. This is here referred to as the "Locked-In Problem" and is exemplified with an experimental case report, followed by practical and social concerns that are accompanied with this problem.

 - **Abstract**
 Transformer verification draws increasing attention in machine learning research and industry. It formally verifies the robustness of transformers against adversarial attacks such as exchanging words in a sentence with synonyms. However, the performance of transformer verification is still not satisfactory due to bound-centric computation which is significantly different from standard neural networks. In this paper, we propose Faith, an efficient framework for transformer verification on GPUs. We first propose a semantic-aware computation graph transformation to identify semantic information such as bound computation in transformer verification. We exploit such semantic information to enable efficient kernel fusion at the computation graph level. Second, we propose a verification-specialized kernel crafter to efficiently map transformer verification to modern GPUs. This crafter exploits a set of GPU hardware supports to accelerate verification specialized operations which are usually memory-intensive. Third, we propose an expert-guided autotuning to incorporate expert knowledge on GPU backends to facilitate large search space exploration. Extensive evaluations show that Faith achieves $2.1\times$ to $3.4\times$ ($2.6\times$ on average) speedup over state-of-the-art frameworks.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding spatial and visual information is essential for a navigation agent who follows natural language instructions. The current Transformer-based VLN agents entangle the orientation and vision information, which limits the gain from the learning of each information source. In this paper, we design a neural agent with explicit Orientation and Vision modules. Those modules learn to ground spatial information and landmark mentions in the instructions to the visual environment more effectively. To strengthen the spatial reasoning and visual perception of the agent, we design specific pre-training tasks to feed and better utilize the corresponding modules in our final navigation model. We evaluate our approach on both Room2room (R2R) and Room4room (R4R) datasets and achieve the state of the art results on both benchmarks.

 Food is essential to human survival. So much so that we have developed different recipes to suit our taste needs. In this work, we propose a novel way of creating new, fine-dining recipes from scratch using Transformers, specifically auto-regressive language models. Given a small dataset of food recipes, we try to train models to identify cooking techniques, propose novel recipes, and test the power of fine-tuning with minimal data.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we empirically study how to make the most of low-resolution frames for efficient video recognition. Existing methods mainly focus on developing compact networks or alleviating temporal redundancy of video inputs to increase efficiency, whereas compressing frame resolution has rarely been considered a promising solution. A major concern is the poor recognition accuracy on low-resolution frames. We thus start by analyzing the underlying causes of performance degradation on low-resolution frames. Our key finding is that the major cause of degradation is not information loss in the down-sampling process, but rather the mismatch between network architecture and input scale. Motivated by the success of knowledge distillation (KD), we propose to bridge the gap between network and input size via cross-resolution KD (ResKD). Our work shows that ResKD is a simple but effective method to boost recognition accuracy on low-resolution frames. Without bells and whistles, ResKD considerably surpasses all competitive methods in terms of efficiency and accuracy on four large-scale benchmark datasets, i.e., ActivityNet, FCVID, Mini-Kinetics, Something-Something V2. In addition, we extensively demonstrate its effectiveness over state-of-the-art architectures, i.e., 3D-CNNs and Video Transformers, and scalability towards super low-resolution frames. The results suggest ResKD can serve as a general inference acceleration method for state-of-the-art video recognition. Our code will be available at https://github.com/CVMI-Lab/ResKD.

 - **Abstract**
 Transformer-based language models utilize the attention mechanism for substantial performance improvements in almost all natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Similar attention structures are also extensively studied in several other areas. Although the attention mechanism enhances the model performances significantly, its quadratic complexity prevents efficient processing of long sequences. Recent works focused on eliminating the disadvantages of computational inefficiency and showed that transformer-based models can still reach competitive results without the attention layer. A pioneering study proposed the FNet, which replaces the attention layer with the Fourier Transform (FT) in the transformer encoder architecture. FNet achieves competitive performances concerning the original transformer encoder model while accelerating training process by removing the computational burden of the attention mechanism. However, the FNet model ignores essential properties of the FT from the classical signal processing that can be leveraged to increase model efficiency further. We propose different methods to deploy FT efficiently in transformer encoder models. Our proposed architectures have smaller number of model parameters, shorter training times, less memory usage, and some additional performance improvements. We demonstrate these improvements through extensive experiments on common benchmarks.

 - **Abstract**
 We explore a data-driven approach for learning to optimize neural networks. We construct a dataset of neural network checkpoints and train a generative model on the parameters. In particular, our model is a conditional diffusion transformer that, given an initial input parameter vector and a prompted loss, error, or return, predicts the distribution over parameter updates that achieve the desired metric. At test time, it can optimize neural networks with unseen parameters for downstream tasks in just one update. We find that our approach successfully generates parameters for a wide range of loss prompts. Moreover, it can sample multimodal parameter solutions and has favorable scaling properties. We apply our method to different neural network architectures and tasks in supervised and reinforcement learning.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) problem in the context of autonomous driving in outdoor settings. We solve the problem by explicitly grounding the navigable regions corresponding to the textual command. At each timestamp, the model predicts a segmentation mask corresponding to the intermediate or the final navigable region. Our work contrasts with existing efforts in VLN, which pose this task as a node selection problem, given a discrete connected graph corresponding to the environment. We do not assume the availability of such a discretised map. Our work moves towards continuity in action space, provides interpretability through visual feedback and allows VLN on commands requiring finer manoeuvres like "park between the two cars". Furthermore, we propose a novel meta-dataset CARLA-NAV to allow efficient training and validation. The dataset comprises pre-recorded training sequences and a live environment for validation and testing. We provide extensive qualitative and quantitive empirical results to validate the efficacy of the proposed approach.

 - **Abstract**
 Efficient and effective exploration in continuous space is a central problem in applying reinforcement learning (RL) to autonomous driving. Skills learned from expert demonstrations or designed for specific tasks can benefit the exploration, but they are usually costly-collected, unbalanced/sub-optimal, or failing to transfer to diverse tasks. However, human drivers can adapt to varied driving tasks without demonstrations by taking efficient and structural explorations in the entire skill space rather than a limited space with task-specific skills. Inspired by the above fact, we propose an RL algorithm exploring all feasible motion skills instead of a limited set of task-specific and object-centric skills. Without demonstrations, our method can still perform well in diverse tasks. First, we build a task-agnostic and ego-centric (TaEc) motion skill library in a pure motion perspective, which is diverse enough to be reusable in different complex tasks. The motion skills are then encoded into a low-dimension latent skill space, in which RL can do exploration efficiently. Validations in various challenging driving scenarios demonstrate that our proposed method, TaEc-RL, outperforms its counterparts significantly in learning efficiency and task performance.
### From One to Many: Dynamic Cross Attention Networks for LiDAR and Camera  Fusion

 - **Abstract**
 LiDAR and cameras are two complementary sensors for 3D perception in autonomous driving. LiDAR point clouds have accurate spatial and geometry information, while RGB images provide textural and color data for context reasoning. To exploit LiDAR and cameras jointly, existing fusion methods tend to align each 3D point to only one projected image pixel based on calibration, namely one-to-one mapping. However, the performance of these approaches highly relies on the calibration quality, which is sensitive to the temporal and spatial synchronization of sensors. Therefore, we propose a Dynamic Cross Attention (DCA) module with a novel one-to-many cross-modality mapping that learns multiple offsets from the initial projection towards the neighborhood and thus develops tolerance to calibration error. Moreover, a \textit{dynamic query enhancement} is proposed to perceive the model-independent calibration, which further strengthens DCA's tolerance to the initial misalignment. The whole fusion architecture named Dynamic Cross Attention Network (DCAN) exploits multi-level image features and adapts to multiple representations of point clouds, which allows DCA to serve as a plug-in fusion module. Extensive experiments on nuScenes and KITTI prove DCA's effectiveness. The proposed DCAN outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the nuScenes detection challenge.

 - **Abstract**
 As modern problems such as autonomous driving, control of robotic components, and medical diagnostics have become increasingly difficult to solve analytically, data-driven decision-making has seen a large gain in interest. Where there are problems with more dimensions of complexity than can be understood by people, data-driven solutions are a strong option. Many of these methods belong to a subdivision of machine learning known as reinforcement learning. Unfortunately, data-driven models often come with uncertainty in how they will perform in the worst of scenarios. Since the solutions are not derived analytically many times, these models will fail unpredictably. In fields such as autonomous driving and medicine, the consequences of these failures could be catastrophic. Various methods are being explored to resolve this issue and one of them is known as adversarial learning. It pits two models against each other by having one model optimize its goals as the opposite of the other model's goals. This type of training has the potential to find models which perform reliably in complex and high stakes settings, although it is not certain when this type of training will work. The goal is to gain insight about when these types of models will reach stable solutions.

 - **Abstract**
 Intelligent vehicles in autonomous driving and obstacle avoidance, the precise relative state of vehicles put forward a higher demand. For a vehicle-borne sensor network with time-varying transmission delays, the problem of coordinate fusion of vehicle state is the focus of this paper. By the ingeniously designed low-complexity integration with a consensus strategy and buffer technology, an anti-delay distributed Kalman filter (DKF) with finite-time convergence is proposed.By introducing the matrix weight to assess local estimates, the optimal fusion state result is available in the sense of linear minimum variance. In addition, to accommodate practical engineering in intelligent vehicles, the communication weight coefficient and directed topology with unidirectional transmission are also considered. From a theoretical perspective, the proof of error covariances upper bounds with different communication topologies with delays are presented. Furthermore, the maximum allowable delays of vehicle-borne sensor network is derived backwards. Simulations verify that while considering various non-ideal factors above, the proposed DFK algorithm produces more accurate and robust fusion estimation state results than existing algorithms, making it more valuable in practical applications. Simultaneously, a mobile car trajectory tracking experiment is carried out, which further verifies the feasibility of the proposed algorithm.

 - **Abstract**
 The design of a safe and reliable Autonomous Driving stack (ADS) is one of the most challenging tasks of our era. These ADS are expected to be driven in highly dynamic environments with full autonomy, and a reliability greater than human beings. In that sense, to efficiently and safely navigate through arbitrarily complex traffic scenarios, ADS must have the ability to forecast the future trajectories of surrounding actors. Current state-of-the-art models are typically based on Recurrent, Graph and Convolutional networks, achieving noticeable results in the context of vehicle prediction. In this paper we explore the influence of attention in generative models for motion prediction, considering both physical and social context to compute the most plausible trajectories. We first encode the past trajectories using a LSTM network, which serves as input to a Multi-Head Self-Attention module that computes the social context. On the other hand, we formulate a weighted interpolation to calculate the velocity and orientation in the last observation frame in order to calculate acceptable target points, extracted from the driveable of the HDMap information, which represents our physical context. Finally, the input of our generator is a white noise vector sampled from a multivariate normal distribution while the social and physical context are its conditions, in order to predict plausible trajectories. We validate our method using the Argoverse Motion Forecasting Benchmark 1.1, achieving competitive unimodal results.
