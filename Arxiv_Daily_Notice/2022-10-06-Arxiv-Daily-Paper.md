 - **Abstract**
 Visual SLAM systems targeting static scenes have been developed with satisfactory accuracy and robustness. Dynamic 3D object tracking has then become a significant capability in visual SLAM with the requirement of understanding dynamic surroundings in various scenarios including autonomous driving, augmented and virtual reality. However, performing dynamic SLAM solely with monocular images remains a challenging problem due to the difficulty of associating dynamic features and estimating their positions. In this paper, we present MOTSLAM, a dynamic visual SLAM system with the monocular configuration that tracks both poses and bounding boxes of dynamic objects. MOTSLAM first performs multiple object tracking (MOT) with associated both 2D and 3D bounding box detection to create initial 3D objects. Then, neural-network-based monocular depth estimation is applied to fetch the depth of dynamic features. Finally, camera poses, object poses, and both static, as well as dynamic map points, are jointly optimized using a novel bundle adjustment. Our experiments on the KITTI dataset demonstrate that our system has reached best performance on both camera ego-motion and object tracking on monocular dynamic SLAM.

 - **Abstract**
 Implementing dynamic locomotion behaviors on legged robots requires a high-quality state estimation module. Especially when the motion includes flight phases, state-of-the-art approaches fail to produce reliable estimation of the robot posture, in particular base height. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for combining visual-inertial odometry (VIO) with leg odometry in an extended Kalman filter (EKF) based state estimator. The VIO module uses a stereo camera and IMU to yield low-drift 3D position and yaw orientation and drift-free pitch and roll orientation of the robot base link in the inertial frame. However, these values have a considerable amount of latency due to image processing and optimization, while the rate of update is quite low which is not suitable for low-level control. To reduce the latency, we predict the VIO state estimate at the rate of the IMU measurements of the VIO sensor. The EKF module uses the base pose and linear velocity predicted by VIO, fuses them further with a second high-rate IMU and leg odometry measurements, and produces robot state estimates with a high frequency and small latency suitable for control. We integrate this lightweight estimation framework with a nonlinear model predictive controller and show successful implementation of a set of agile locomotion behaviors, including trotting and jumping at varying horizontal speeds, on a torque-controlled quadruped robot.

 - **Abstract**
 Motion planning for safe autonomous driving requires learning how the environment around an ego-vehicle evolves with time. Ego-centric perception of driveable regions in a scene not only changes with the motion of actors in the environment, but also with the movement of the ego-vehicle itself. Self-supervised representations proposed for large-scale planning, such as ego-centric freespace, confound these two motions, making the representation difficult to use for downstream motion planners. In this paper, we use geometric occupancy as a natural alternative to view-dependent representations such as freespace. Occupancy maps naturally disentangle the motion of the environment from the motion of the ego-vehicle. However, one cannot directly observe the full 3D occupancy of a scene (due to occlusion), making it difficult to use as a signal for learning. Our key insight is to use differentiable raycasting to "render" future occupancy predictions into future LiDAR sweep predictions, which can be compared with ground-truth sweeps for self-supervised learning. The use of differentiable raycasting allows occupancy to emerge as an internal representation within the forecasting network. In the absence of groundtruth occupancy, we quantitatively evaluate the forecasting of raycasted LiDAR sweeps and show improvements of upto 15 F1 points. For downstream motion planners, where emergent occupancy can be directly used to guide non-driveable regions, this representation relatively reduces the number of collisions with objects by up to 17% as compared to freespace-centric motion planners.

 - **Abstract**
 Accurate mapping of large-scale environments is an essential building block of most outdoor autonomous systems. Challenges of traditional mapping methods include the balance between memory consumption and mapping accuracy. This paper addresses the problems of achieving large-scale 3D reconstructions with implicit representations using 3D LiDAR measurements. We learn and store implicit features through an octree-based hierarchical structure, which is sparse and extensible. The features can be turned into signed distance values through a shallow neural network. We leverage binary cross entropy loss to optimize the local features with the 3D measurements as supervision. Based on our implicit representation, we design an incremental mapping system with regularization to tackle the issue of catastrophic forgetting in continual learning. Our experiments show that our 3D reconstructions are more accurate, complete, and memory-efficient than current state-of-the-art 3D mapping methods.

### Representing missing values through polar encoding

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.01905
 - **Abstract**
 We propose polar encoding, a representation of categorical and numerical $[0,1]$-valued attributes with missing values that preserves the information encoded in the distribution of the missing values. Unlike the existing missing-indicator approach, this does not require imputation. We support our proposal with three different arguments. Firstly, polar encoding ensures that missing values become equidistant from all non-missing values by mapping the latter onto the unit circle. Secondly, polar encoding lets decision trees choose how missing values should be split, providing a practical realisation of the missingness incorporated in attributes (MIA) proposal. And lastly, polar encoding corresponds to the normalised representation of categorical and $[0,1]$-valued attributes when viewed as barycentric attributes, a new concept based on traditional barycentric coordinates. In particular, we show that barycentric attributes are fuzzified categorical attributes, that their normalised representation generalises one-hot encoding, and that the polar encoding of $[0, 1]$-valued attributes is analogous to the one-hot encoding of binary attributes. With an experiment based on twenty real-life datasets with missing values, we show that polar encoding performs about as well or better than the missing-indicator approach in terms of the resulting classification performance.

 - **Abstract**
 With the prevalence of image editing techniques, users can create fantastic synthetic images, but the image quality may be compromised by the color/illumination discrepancy between the manipulated region and background. Inharmonious region localization aims to localize the inharmonious region in a synthetic image. In this work, we attempt to leverage auxiliary style feature to facilitate this task. Specifically, we propose a novel color mapping module and a style feature loss to extract discriminative style features containing task-relevant color/illumination information. Based on the extracted style features, we also propose a novel style voting module to guide the localization of inharmonious region. Moreover, we introduce semantic information into the style voting module to achieve further improvement. Our method surpasses the existing methods by a large margin on the benchmark dataset.

 - **Abstract**
 Conventional forgery localizing methods usually rely on different forgery footprints such as JPEG artifacts, edge inconsistency, camera noise, etc., with cross-entropy loss to locate manipulated regions. However, these methods have the disadvantage of over-fitting and focusing on only a few specific forgery footprints. On the other hand, real-life manipulated images are generated via a wide variety of forgery operations and thus, leave behind a wide variety of forgery footprints. Therefore, we need a more general approach for image forgery localization that can work well on a variety of forgery conditions. A key assumption in underlying forged region localization is that there remains a difference of feature distribution between untampered and manipulated regions in each forged image sample, irrespective of the forgery type. In this paper, we aim to leverage this difference of feature distribution to aid in image forgery localization. Specifically, we use contrastive loss to learn mapping into a feature space where the features between untampered and manipulated regions are well-separated for each image. Also, our method has the advantage of localizing manipulated region without requiring any prior knowledge or assumption about the forgery type. We demonstrate that our work outperforms several existing methods on three benchmark image manipulation datasets. Code is available at https://github.com/niloy193/CFLNet.

 - **Abstract**
 Data hiding with deep neural networks (DNNs) has experienced impressive successes in recent years. A prevailing scheme is to train an autoencoder, consisting of an encoding network to embed (or transform) secret messages in (or into) a carrier, and a decoding network to extract the hidden messages. This scheme may suffer from several limitations regarding practicability, security, and embedding capacity. In this work, we describe a different computational framework to hide images in deep probabilistic models. Specifically, we use a DNN to model the probability density of cover images, and hide a secret image in one particular location of the learned distribution. As an instantiation, we adopt a SinGAN, a pyramid of generative adversarial networks (GANs), to learn the patch distribution of one cover image. We hide the secret image by fitting a deterministic mapping from a fixed set of noise maps (generated by an embedding key) to the secret image during patch distribution learning. The stego SinGAN, behaving as the original SinGAN, is publicly communicated; only the receiver with the embedding key is able to extract the secret image. We demonstrate the feasibility of our SinGAN approach in terms of extraction accuracy and model security. Moreover, we show the flexibility of the proposed method in terms of hiding multiple images for different receivers and obfuscating the secret image.

 - **Abstract**
 Video question answering (VideoQA) is an essential task in vision-language understanding, which has attracted numerous research attention recently. Nevertheless, existing works mostly achieve promising performances on short videos of duration within 15 seconds. For VideoQA on minute-level long-term videos, those methods are likely to fail because of lacking the ability to deal with noise and redundancy caused by scene changes and multiple actions in the video. Considering the fact that the question often remains concentrated in a short temporal range, we propose to first locate the question to a segment in the video and then infer the answer using the located segment only. Under this scheme, we propose "Locate before Answering" (LocAns), a novel approach that integrates a question locator and an answer predictor into an end-to-end model. During the training phase, the available answer label not only serves as the supervision signal of the answer predictor, but also is used to generate pseudo temporal labels for the question locator. Moreover, we design a decoupled alternative training strategy to update the two modules separately. In the experiments, LocAns achieves state-of-the-art performance on two modern long-term VideoQA datasets NExT-QA and ActivityNet-QA, and its qualitative examples show the reliable performance of the question localization.

 - **Abstract**
 Manipulation tools that realistically edit images are widely available, making it easy for anyone to create and spread misinformation. In an attempt to fight fake news, forgery detection and localization methods were designed. However, existing methods struggle to accurately reveal manipulations found in images on the internet, i.e., in the wild. That is because the type of forgery is typically unknown, in addition to the tampering traces being damaged by recompression. This paper presents Comprint, a novel forgery detection and localization method based on the compression fingerprint or comprint. It is trained on pristine data only, providing generalization to detect different types of manipulation. Additionally, we propose a fusion of Comprint with the state-of-the-art Noiseprint, which utilizes a complementary camera model fingerprint. We carry out an extensive experimental analysis and demonstrate that Comprint has a high level of accuracy on five evaluation datasets that represent a wide range of manipulation types, mimicking in-the-wild circumstances. Most notably, the proposed fusion significantly outperforms state-of-the-art reference methods. As such, Comprint and the fusion Comprint+Noiseprint represent a promising forensics tool to analyze in-the-wild tampered images.

 The SoccerNet 2022 challenges were the second annual video understanding challenges organized by the SoccerNet team. In 2022, the challenges were composed of 6 vision-based tasks: (1) action spotting, focusing on retrieving action timestamps in long untrimmed videos, (2) replay grounding, focusing on retrieving the live moment of an action shown in a replay, (3) pitch localization, focusing on detecting line and goal part elements, (4) camera calibration, dedicated to retrieving the intrinsic and extrinsic camera parameters, (5) player re-identification, focusing on retrieving the same players across multiple views, and (6) multiple object tracking, focusing on tracking players and the ball through unedited video streams. Compared to last year's challenges, tasks (1-2) had their evaluation metrics redefined to consider tighter temporal accuracies, and tasks (3-6) were novel, including their underlying data and annotations. More information on the tasks, challenges and leaderboards are available on https://www.soccer-net.org. Baselines and development kits are available on https://github.com/SoccerNet.

### MOAT: Alternating Mobile Convolution and Attention Brings Strong Vision  Models

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.01820
 - **Abstract**
 This paper presents MOAT, a family of neural networks that build on top of MObile convolution (i.e., inverted residual blocks) and ATtention. Unlike the current works that stack separate mobile convolution and transformer blocks, we effectively merge them into a MOAT block. Starting with a standard Transformer block, we replace its multi-layer perceptron with a mobile convolution block, and further reorder it before the self-attention operation. The mobile convolution block not only enhances the network representation capacity, but also produces better downsampled features. Our conceptually simple MOAT networks are surprisingly effective, achieving 89.1% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K with ImageNet-22K pretraining. Additionally, MOAT can be seamlessly applied to downstream tasks that require large resolution inputs by simply converting the global attention to window attention. Thanks to the mobile convolution that effectively exchanges local information between pixels (and thus cross-windows), MOAT does not need the extra window-shifting mechanism. As a result, on COCO object detection, MOAT achieves 59.2% box AP with 227M model parameters (single-scale inference, and hard NMS), and on ADE20K semantic segmentation, MOAT attains 57.6% mIoU with 496M model parameters (single-scale inference). Finally, the tiny-MOAT family, obtained by simply reducing the channel sizes, also surprisingly outperforms several mobile-specific transformer-based models on ImageNet. We hope our simple yet effective MOAT will inspire more seamless integration of convolution and self-attention. Code is made publicly available.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.01869
 - **Abstract**
 The computational complexity of the self-attention mechanism in Transformer models significantly limits their ability to generalize over long temporal durations. Memory-augmentation, or the explicit storing of past information in external memory for subsequent predictions, has become a constructive avenue for mitigating this limitation. We argue that memory-augmented Transformers can benefit substantially from considering insights from the memory literature in humans. We detail an approach to integrating evidence from the human memory system through the specification of cross-domain linking hypotheses. We then provide an empirical demonstration to evaluate the use of surprisal as a linking hypothesis, and further identify the limitations of this approach to inform future research.

 - **Abstract**
 Research on video frame interpolation has made significant progress in recent years. However, existing methods mostly use off-the-shelf metrics to measure the quality of interpolation results with the exception of a few methods that employ user studies, which is time-consuming. As video frame interpolation results often exhibit unique artifacts, existing quality metrics sometimes are not consistent with human perception when measuring the interpolation results. Some recent deep learning-based perceptual quality metrics are shown more consistent with human judgments, but their performance on videos is compromised since they do not consider temporal information. In this paper, we present a dedicated perceptual quality metric for measuring video frame interpolation results. Our method learns perceptual features directly from videos instead of individual frames. It compares pyramid features extracted from video frames and employs Swin Transformer blocks-based spatio-temporal modules to extract spatio-temporal information. To train our metric, we collected a new video frame interpolation quality assessment dataset. Our experiments show that our dedicated quality metric outperforms state-of-the-art methods when measuring video frame interpolation results. Our code and model are made publicly available at \url{https://github.com/hqqxyy/VFIPS}.

 - **Abstract**
 Existing methods for human mesh recovery mainly focus on single-view frameworks, but they often fail to produce accurate results due to the ill-posed setup. Considering the maturity of the multi-view motion capture system, in this paper, we propose to solve the prior ill-posed problem by leveraging multiple images from different views, thus significantly enhancing the quality of recovered meshes. In particular, we present a novel \textbf{M}ulti-view human body \textbf{M}esh \textbf{T}ranslator (MMT) model for estimating human body mesh with the help of vision transformer. Specifically, MMT takes multi-view images as input and translates them to targeted meshes in a single-forward manner. MMT fuses features of different views in both encoding and decoding phases, leading to representations embedded with global information. Additionally, to ensure the tokens are intensively focused on the human pose and shape, MMT conducts cross-view alignment at the feature level by projecting 3D keypoint positions to each view and enforcing their consistency in geometry constraints. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that MMT outperforms existing single or multi-view models by a large margin for human mesh recovery task, notably, 28.8\% improvement in MPVE over the current state-of-the-art method on the challenging HUMBI dataset. Qualitative evaluation also verifies the effectiveness of MMT in reconstructing high-quality human mesh. Codes will be made available upon acceptance.

 - **Abstract**
 Ensemble of machine learning models yields improved performance as well as robustness. However, their memory requirements and inference costs can be prohibitively high. Knowledge distillation is an approach that allows a single model to efficiently capture the approximate performance of an ensemble while showing poor scalability as demand for re-training when introducing new teacher models. In this paper, we study if we can utilize the meta-learning strategy to directly predict the parameters of a single model with comparable performance of an ensemble. Hereto, we introduce WeightFormer, a Transformer-based model that can predict student network weights layer by layer in a forward pass, according to the teacher model parameters. The proprieties of WeightFormer are investigated on the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet datasets for model structures of VGGNet-11, ResNet-50, and ViT-B/32, where it demonstrates that our method can achieve approximate classification performance of an ensemble and outperforms both the single network and standard knowledge distillation. More encouragingly, we show that WeightFormer results can further exceeds average ensemble with minor fine-tuning. Importantly, our task along with the model and results can potentially lead to a new, more efficient, and scalable paradigm of ensemble networks parameter learning.
### Waveformer: Linear-Time Attention with Forward and Backward Wavelet  Transform

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.01989
 - **Abstract**
 We propose Waveformer that learns attention mechanism in the wavelet coefficient space, requires only linear time complexity, and enjoys universal approximating power. Specifically, we first apply forward wavelet transform to project the input sequences to multi-resolution orthogonal wavelet bases, then conduct nonlinear transformations (in this case, a random feature kernel) in the wavelet coefficient space, and finally reconstruct the representation in input space via backward wavelet transform. We note that other non-linear transformations may be used, hence we name the learning paradigm Wavelet transformatIon for Sequence lEarning (WISE). We emphasize the importance of backward reconstruction in the WISE paradigm -- without it, one would be mixing information from both the input space and coefficient space through skip connections, which shall not be considered as mathematically sound. Compared with Fourier transform in recent works, wavelet transform is more efficient in time complexity and better captures local and positional information; we further support this through our ablation studies. Extensive experiments on seven long-range understanding datasets from the Long Range Arena benchmark and code understanding tasks demonstrate that (1) Waveformer achieves competitive and even better accuracy than a number of state-of-the-art Transformer variants and (2) WISE can boost accuracies of various attention approximation methods without increasing the time complexity. These together showcase the superiority of learning attention in a wavelet coefficient space over the input space.
### Point Cloud Recognition with Position-to-Structure Attention  Transformers

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02030
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.02030
 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we present Position-to-Structure Attention Transformers (PS-Former), a Transformer-based algorithm for 3D point cloud recognition. PS-Former deals with the challenge in 3D point cloud representation where points are not positioned in a fixed grid structure and have limited feature description (only 3D coordinates ($x, y, z$) for scattered points). Existing Transformer-based architectures in this domain often require a pre-specified feature engineering step to extract point features. Here, we introduce two new aspects in PS-Former: 1) a learnable condensation layer that performs point downsampling and feature extraction; and 2) a Position-to-Structure Attention mechanism that recursively enriches the structural information with the position attention branch. Compared with the competing methods, while being generic with less heuristics feature designs, PS-Former demonstrates competitive experimental results on three 3D point cloud tasks including classification, part segmentation, and scene segmentation.

 - **Abstract**
 Subsurface tile drainage pipes provide agronomic, economic and environmental benefits. By lowering the water table of wet soils, they improve the aeration of plant roots and ultimately increase the productivity of farmland. They do however also provide an entryway of agrochemicals into subsurface water bodies and increase nutrition loss in soils. For maintenance and infrastructural development, accurate maps of tile drainage pipe locations and drained agricultural land are needed. However, these maps are often outdated or not present. Different remote sensing (RS) image processing techniques have been applied over the years with varying degrees of success to overcome these restrictions. Recent developments in deep learning (DL) techniques improve upon the conventional techniques with machine learning segmentation models. In this study, we introduce two DL-based models: i) improved U-Net architecture; and ii) Visual Transformer-based encoder-decoder in the framework of tile drainage pipe detection. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of both models in terms of detection accuracy when compared to a basic U-Net architecture. Our code and models are publicly available at \url{https://git.tu-berlin.de/rsim/drainage-pipes-detection}.

 - **Abstract**
 Masked image modeling (MIM) has become a popular strategy for self-supervised learning~(SSL) of visual representations with Vision Transformers. A representative MIM model, the masked auto-encoder (MAE), randomly masks a subset of image patches and reconstructs the masked patches given the unmasked patches. Concurrently, many recent works in self-supervised learning utilize the student/teacher paradigm which provides the student with an additional target based on the output of a teacher composed of an exponential moving average (EMA) of previous students. Although common, relatively little is known about the dynamics of the interaction between the student and teacher. Through analysis on a simple linear model, we find that the teacher conditionally removes previous gradient directions based on feature similarities which effectively acts as a conditional momentum regularizer. From this analysis, we present a simple SSL method, the Reconstruction-Consistent Masked Auto-Encoder (RC-MAE) by adding an EMA teacher to MAE. We find that RC-MAE converges faster and requires less memory usage than state-of-the-art self-distillation methods during pre-training, which may provide a way to enhance the practicality of prohibitively expensive self-supervised learning of Vision Transformer models. Additionally, we show that RC-MAE achieves more robustness and better performance compared to MAE on downstream tasks such as ImageNet-1K classification, object detection, and instance segmentation.

 - **Abstract**
 Conditional generation of time-dependent data is a task that has much interest, whether for data augmentation, scenario simulation, completing missing data, or other purposes. Recent works proposed a Transformer-based Time series generative adversarial network (TTS-GAN) to address the limitations of recurrent neural networks. However, this model assumes a unimodal distribution and tries to generate samples around the expectation of the real data distribution. One of its limitations is that it may generate a random multivariate time series; it may fail to generate samples in the presence of multiple sub-components within an overall distribution. One could train models to fit each sub-component separately to overcome this limitation. Our work extends the TTS-GAN by conditioning its generated output on a particular encoded context allowing the use of one model to fit a mixture distribution with multiple sub-components. Technically, it is a conditional generative adversarial network that models realistic multivariate time series under different types of conditions, such as categorical variables or multivariate time series. We evaluate our model on UniMiB Dataset, which contains acceleration data following the XYZ axes of human activities collected using Smartphones. We use qualitative evaluations and quantitative metrics such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and we introduce a modified version of the Frechet inception distance (FID) to measure the performance of our model and the statistical similarities between the generated and the real data distributions. We show that this transformer-based CGAN can generate realistic high-dimensional and long data sequences under different kinds of conditions.

 - **Abstract**
 Visual feature pyramid has shown its superiority in both effectiveness and efficiency in a wide range of applications. However, the existing methods exorbitantly concentrate on the inter-layer feature interactions but ignore the intra-layer feature regulations, which are empirically proved beneficial. Although some methods try to learn a compact intra-layer feature representation with the help of the attention mechanism or the vision transformer, they ignore the neglected corner regions that are important for dense prediction tasks. To address this problem, in this paper, we propose a Centralized Feature Pyramid (CFP) for object detection, which is based on a globally explicit centralized feature regulation. Specifically, we first propose a spatial explicit visual center scheme, where a lightweight MLP is used to capture the globally long-range dependencies and a parallel learnable visual center mechanism is used to capture the local corner regions of the input images. Based on this, we then propose a globally centralized regulation for the commonly-used feature pyramid in a top-down fashion, where the explicit visual center information obtained from the deepest intra-layer feature is used to regulate frontal shallow features. Compared to the existing feature pyramids, CFP not only has the ability to capture the global long-range dependencies, but also efficiently obtain an all-round yet discriminative feature representation. Experimental results on the challenging MS-COCO validate that our proposed CFP can achieve the consistent performance gains on the state-of-the-art YOLOv5 and YOLOX object detection baselines.

 - **Abstract**
 Large-scale self-supervised pre-training Transformer architecture have significantly boosted the performance for various tasks in natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV). However, there is a lack of researches on processing multivariate time-series by pre-trained Transformer, and especially, current study on masking time-series for self-supervised learning is still a gap. Different from language and image processing, the information density of time-series increases the difficulty of research. The challenge goes further with the invalidity of the previous patch embedding and mask methods. In this paper, according to the data characteristics of multivariate time-series, a patch embedding method is proposed, and we present an self-supervised pre-training approach based on Masked Autoencoders (MAE), called MTSMAE, which can improve the performance significantly over supervised learning without pre-training. Evaluating our method on several common multivariate time-series datasets from different fields and with different characteristics, experiment results demonstrate that the performance of our method is significantly better than the best method currently available.

 - **Abstract**
 Communication technologies enable coordination among connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs). However, it remains unclear how to utilize shared information to improve the safety and efficiency of the CAV system. In this work, we propose a framework of constrained multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) with a parallel safety shield for CAVs in challenging driving scenarios. The coordination mechanisms of the proposed MARL include information sharing and cooperative policy learning, with Graph Convolutional Network (GCN)-Transformer as a spatial-temporal encoder that enhances the agent's environment awareness. The safety shield module with Control Barrier Functions (CBF)-based safety checking protects the agents from taking unsafe actions. We design a constrained multi-agent advantage actor-critic (CMAA2C) algorithm to train safe and cooperative policies for CAVs. With the experiment deployed in the CARLA simulator, we verify the effectiveness of the safety checking, spatial-temporal encoder, and coordination mechanisms designed in our method by comparative experiments in several challenging scenarios with the defined hazard vehicles (HAZV). Results show that our proposed methodology significantly increases system safety and efficiency in challenging scenarios.

 - **Abstract**
 Generating long, temporally consistent video remains an open challenge in video generation. Primarily due to computational limitations, most prior methods limit themselves to training on a small subset of frames that are then extended to generate longer videos through a sliding window fashion. Although these techniques may produce sharp videos, they have difficulty retaining long-term temporal consistency due to their limited context length. In this work, we present Temporally Consistent Video Transformer (TECO), a vector-quantized latent dynamics video prediction model that learns compressed representations to efficiently condition on long videos of hundreds of frames during both training and generation. We use a MaskGit prior for dynamics prediction which enables both sharper and faster generations compared to prior work. Our experiments show that TECO outperforms SOTA baselines in a variety of video prediction benchmarks ranging from simple mazes in DMLab, large 3D worlds in Minecraft, and complex real-world videos from Kinetics-600. In addition, to better understand the capabilities of video prediction models in modeling temporal consistency, we introduce several challenging video prediction tasks consisting of agents randomly traversing 3D scenes of varying difficulty. This presents a challenging benchmark for video prediction in partially observable environments where a model must understand what parts of the scenes to re-create versus invent depending on its past observations or generations.

 - **Abstract**
 We present Phenaki, a model capable of realistic video synthesis, given a sequence of textual prompts. Generating videos from text is particularly challenging due to the computational cost, limited quantities of high quality text-video data and variable length of videos. To address these issues, we introduce a new model for learning video representation which compresses the video to a small representation of discrete tokens. This tokenizer uses causal attention in time, which allows it to work with variable-length videos. To generate video tokens from text we are using a bidirectional masked transformer conditioned on pre-computed text tokens. The generated video tokens are subsequently de-tokenized to create the actual video. To address data issues, we demonstrate how joint training on a large corpus of image-text pairs as well as a smaller number of video-text examples can result in generalization beyond what is available in the video datasets. Compared to the previous video generation methods, Phenaki can generate arbitrary long videos conditioned on a sequence of prompts (i.e. time variable text or a story) in open domain. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time a paper studies generating videos from time variable prompts. In addition, compared to the per-frame baselines, the proposed video encoder-decoder computes fewer tokens per video but results in better spatio-temporal consistency.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper presents a web-based demonstration of Emotion Twenty Questions (EMO20Q), a dialog game whose purpose is to study how people describe emotions. EMO20Q can also be used to develop artificially intelligent dialog agents that can play the game. In previous work, an EMO20Q agent used a sequential Bayesian machine learning model and could play the question-asking role. Newer transformer-based neural machine learning models have made it possible to develop an agent for the question-answering role. This demo paper describes the recent developments in the question-answering role of the EMO20Q game, which requires the agent to respond to more open-ended inputs. Furthermore, we also describe the design of the system, including the web-based front-end, agent architecture and programming, and updates to earlier software used. The demo system will be available to collect pilot data during the ACII conference and this data will be used to inform future experiments and system design.

 - **Abstract**
 Nearest neighbor search (NNS) aims to locate the points in high-dimensional space that is closest to the query point. The brute-force approach for finding the nearest neighbor becomes computationally infeasible when the number of points is large. The NNS has multiple applications in medicine, such as searching large medical imaging databases, disease classification, diagnosis, etc. With a focus on medical imaging, this paper proposes DenseLinkSearch an effective and efficient algorithm that searches and retrieves the relevant images from heterogeneous sources of medical images. Towards this, given a medical database, the proposed algorithm builds the index that consists of pre-computed links of each point in the database. The search algorithm utilizes the index to efficiently traverse the database in search of the nearest neighbor. We extensively tested the proposed NNS approach and compared the performance with state-of-the-art NNS approaches on benchmark datasets and our created medical image datasets. The proposed approach outperformed the existing approach in terms of retrieving accurate neighbors and retrieval speed. We also explore the role of medical image feature representation in content-based medical image retrieval tasks. We propose a Transformer-based feature representation technique that outperformed the existing pre-trained Transformer approach on CLEF 2011 medical image retrieval task.

 - **Abstract**
 Motion planning for safe autonomous driving requires learning how the environment around an ego-vehicle evolves with time. Ego-centric perception of driveable regions in a scene not only changes with the motion of actors in the environment, but also with the movement of the ego-vehicle itself. Self-supervised representations proposed for large-scale planning, such as ego-centric freespace, confound these two motions, making the representation difficult to use for downstream motion planners. In this paper, we use geometric occupancy as a natural alternative to view-dependent representations such as freespace. Occupancy maps naturally disentangle the motion of the environment from the motion of the ego-vehicle. However, one cannot directly observe the full 3D occupancy of a scene (due to occlusion), making it difficult to use as a signal for learning. Our key insight is to use differentiable raycasting to "render" future occupancy predictions into future LiDAR sweep predictions, which can be compared with ground-truth sweeps for self-supervised learning. The use of differentiable raycasting allows occupancy to emerge as an internal representation within the forecasting network. In the absence of groundtruth occupancy, we quantitatively evaluate the forecasting of raycasted LiDAR sweeps and show improvements of upto 15 F1 points. For downstream motion planners, where emergent occupancy can be directly used to guide non-driveable regions, this representation relatively reduces the number of collisions with objects by up to 17% as compared to freespace-centric motion planners.

 - **Abstract**
 Visual SLAM systems targeting static scenes have been developed with satisfactory accuracy and robustness. Dynamic 3D object tracking has then become a significant capability in visual SLAM with the requirement of understanding dynamic surroundings in various scenarios including autonomous driving, augmented and virtual reality. However, performing dynamic SLAM solely with monocular images remains a challenging problem due to the difficulty of associating dynamic features and estimating their positions. In this paper, we present MOTSLAM, a dynamic visual SLAM system with the monocular configuration that tracks both poses and bounding boxes of dynamic objects. MOTSLAM first performs multiple object tracking (MOT) with associated both 2D and 3D bounding box detection to create initial 3D objects. Then, neural-network-based monocular depth estimation is applied to fetch the depth of dynamic features. Finally, camera poses, object poses, and both static, as well as dynamic map points, are jointly optimized using a novel bundle adjustment. Our experiments on the KITTI dataset demonstrate that our system has reached best performance on both camera ego-motion and object tracking on monocular dynamic SLAM.

 - **Abstract**
 In engineering design, one often wishes to calculate the probability that the performance of a system is satisfactory under uncertainty. State of the art algorithms exist to solve this problem using active learning with Gaussian process models. However, these algorithms cannot be applied to problems which often occur in the autonomous vehicle domain where the performance of a system may be undefined under certain circumstances. Na\"ive modification of existing algorithms by simply masking undefined values will introduce a discontinuous system performance function, and would be unsuccessful because these algorithms are known to fail for discontinuous performance functions. We solve this problem using a hierarchical model for the system performance, where undefined performance is classified before the performance is regressed. This enables active learning Gaussian process methods to be applied to problems where the performance of the system is sometimes undefined, and we demonstrate this by testing our methodology on synthetic numerical examples for the autonomous driving domain.

 - **Abstract**
 Self-supervised monocular depth estimation is a salient task for 3D scene understanding. Learned jointly with monocular ego-motion estimation, several methods have been proposed to predict accurate pixel-wise depth without using labeled data. Nevertheless, these methods focus on improving performance under ideal conditions without natural or digital corruptions. A general absence of occlusions is assumed even for object-specific depth estimation. These methods are also vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which is a pertinent concern for their reliable deployment on robots and autonomous driving systems. We propose MIMDepth, a method that adapts masked image modeling (MIM) for self-supervised monocular depth estimation. While MIM has been used to learn generalizable features during pre-training, we show how it could be adapted for direct training of monocular depth estimation. Our experiments show that MIMDepth is more robust to noise, blur, weather conditions, digital artifacts, occlusions, as well as untargeted and targeted adversarial attacks.
