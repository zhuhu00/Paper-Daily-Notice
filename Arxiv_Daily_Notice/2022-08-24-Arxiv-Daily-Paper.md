 - **Abstract**
 3D Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) has achieved tremendous achievement thanks to the rapid development of 3D object detection and 2D MOT. Recent advanced works generally employ a series of object attributes, e.g., position, size, velocity, and appearance, to provide the clues for the association in 3D MOT. However, these cues may not be reliable due to some visual noise, such as occlusion and blur, leading to tracking performance bottleneck. To reveal the dilemma, we conduct extensive empirical analysis to expose the key bottleneck of each clue and how they correlate with each other. The analysis results motivate us to efficiently absorb the merits among all cues, and adaptively produce an optimal tacking manner. Specifically, we present Location and Velocity Quality Learning, which efficiently guides the network to estimate the quality of predicted object attributes. Based on these quality estimations, we propose a quality-aware object association (QOA) strategy to leverage the quality score as an important reference factor for achieving robust association. Despite its simplicity, extensive experiments indicate that the proposed strategy significantly boosts tracking performance by 2.2% AMOTA and our method outperforms all existing state-of-the-art works on nuScenes by a large margin. Moreover, QTrack achieves 48.0% and 51.1% AMOTA tracking performance on the nuScenes validation and test sets, which significantly reduces the performance gap between pure camera and LiDAR based trackers.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper presents a design space of interaction techniques to engage with visualizations that are printed on paper and augmented through Augmented Reality. Paper sheets are widely used to deploy visualizations and provide a rich set of tangible affordances for interactions, such as touch, folding, tilting, or stacking. At the same time, augmented reality can dynamically update visualization content to provide commands such as pan, zoom, filter, or detail on demand. This paper is the first to provide a structured approach to mapping possible actions with the paper to interaction commands. This design space and the findings of a controlled user study have implications for future designs of augmented reality systems involving paper sheets and visualizations. Through workshops (N=20) and ideation, we identified 81 interactions that we classify in three dimensions: 1) commands that can be supported by an interaction, 2) the specific parameters provided by an (inter)action with paper, and 3) the number of paper sheets involved in an interaction. We tested user preference and viability of 11 of these interactions with a prototype implementation in a controlled study (N=12, HoloLens 2) and found that most of the interactions are intuitive and engaging to use. We summarized interactions (e.g., tilt to pan) that have strong affordance to complement "point" for data exploration, physical limitations and properties of paper as a medium, cases requiring redundancy and shortcuts, and other implications for design.

 - **Abstract**
 We propose a novel framework to reconstruct super-resolution human shape from a single low-resolution input image. The approach overcomes limitations of existing approaches that reconstruct 3D human shape from a single image, which require high-resolution images together with auxiliary data such as surface normal or a parametric model to reconstruct high-detail shape. The proposed framework represents the reconstructed shape with a high-detail implicit function. Analogous to the objective of 2D image super-resolution, the approach learns the mapping from a low-resolution shape to its high-resolution counterpart and it is applied to reconstruct 3D shape detail from low-resolution images. The approach is trained end-to-end employing a novel loss function which estimates the information lost between a low and high-resolution representation of the same 3D surface shape. Evaluation for single image reconstruction of clothed people demonstrates that our method achieves high-detail surface reconstruction from low-resolution images without auxiliary data. Extensive experiments show that the proposed approach can estimate super-resolution human geometries with a significantly higher level of detail than that obtained with previous approaches when applied to low-resolution images.

 - **Abstract**
 Accurate, detailed, and timely crop type mapping is a very valuable information for the institutions in order to create more accurate policies according to the needs of the citizens. In the last decade, the amount of available data dramatically increased, whether it can come from Remote Sensing (using Copernicus Sentinel-2 data) or directly from the farmers (providing in-situ crop information throughout the years and information on crop rotation). Nevertheless, the majority of the studies are restricted to the use of one modality (Remote Sensing data or crop rotation) and never fuse the Earth Observation data with domain knowledge like crop rotations. Moreover, when they use Earth Observation data they are mainly restrained to one year of data, not taking into account the past years. In this context, we propose to tackle a land use and crop type classification task using three data types, by using a Hierarchical Deep Learning algorithm modeling the crop rotations like a language model, the satellite signals like a speech signal and using the crop distribution as additional context vector. We obtained very promising results compared to classical approaches with significant performances, increasing the Accuracy by 5.1 points in a 28-class setting (.948), and the micro-F1 by 9.6 points in a 10-class setting (.887) using only a set of crop of interests selected by an expert. We finally proposed a data-augmentation technique to allow the model to classify the crop before the end of the season, which works surprisingly well in a multimodal setting.

 - **Abstract**
 Mapping people dynamics is a crucial skill, because it enables robots to coexist in human-inhabited environments. However, learning a model of people dynamics is a time consuming process which requires observation of large amount of people moving in an environment. Moreover, approaches for mapping dynamics are unable to transfer the learned models across environments: each model only able to describe the dynamics of the environment it has been built in. However, the effect of architectural geometry on people movement can be used to estimate their dynamics, and recent work has looked into learning maps of dynamics from geometry. So far however, these methods have evaluated their performance only on small-size synthetic data, leaving the actual ability of these approaches to generalize to real conditions unexplored. In this work we propose a novel approach to learn people dynamics from geometry, where a model is trained and evaluated on real human trajectories in large-scale environments. We then show the ability of our method to generalize to unseen environments, which is unprecedented for maps of dynamics.

 - **Abstract**
 We study an inverse problem for the wave equation, concerned with estimating the wave speed, aka velocity, from data gathered by an array of sources and receivers that emit probing signals and measure the resulting waves. The typical mathematical formulation of velocity estimation is a nonlinear least squares minimization of the data misfit, over a search velocity space. There are two main impediments to this approach, which manifest as multiple local minima of the objective function: The nonlinearity of the mapping from the velocity to the data, which accounts for multiple scattering effects, and poor knowledge of the kinematics (smooth part of the wave speed) which causes cycle-skipping. We show that the nonlinearity can be mitigated using a data driven estimate of the internal wave field. This leads to improved performance of the inversion for a reasonable initial guess of the kinematics.

 - **Abstract**
 With the progress of the urbanisation process, the urban transportation system is extremely critical to the development of cities and the quality of life of the citizens. Among them, it is one of the most important tasks to judge traffic congestion by analysing the congestion factors. Recently, various traditional and machine-learning-based models have been introduced for predicting traffic congestion. However, these models are either poorly aggregated for massive congestion factors or fail to make accurate predictions for every precise location in large-scale space. To alleviate these problems, a novel end-to-end framework based on convolutional neural networks is proposed in this paper. With learning representations, the framework proposes a novel multimodal fusion module and a novel representation mapping module to achieve traffic congestion predictions on arbitrary query locations on a large-scale map, combined with various global reference information. The proposed framework achieves significant results and efficient inference on real-world large-scale datasets.

 - **Abstract**
 Failure management plays a significant role in optical networks. It ensures secure operation, mitigates potential risks, and executes proactive protection. Machine learning (ML) is considered to be an extremely powerful technique for performing comprehensive data analysis and complex network management and is widely utilized for failure management in optical networks to revolutionize the conventional manual methods. In this study, the background of failure management is introduced, where typical failure tasks, physical objects, ML algorithms, data source, and extracted information are illustrated in detail. An overview of the applications of ML in failure management is provided in terms of alarm analysis, failure prediction, failure detection, failure localization, and failure identification. Finally, the future directions on ML for failure management are discussed from the perspective of data, model, task, and emerging techniques.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.10547
 - **Abstract**
 Recent transformer-based offline video instance segmentation (VIS) approaches achieve encouraging results and significantly outperform online approaches. However, their reliance on the whole video and the immense computational complexity caused by full Spatio-temporal attention limit them in real-life applications such as processing lengthy videos. In this paper, we propose a single-stage transformer-based efficient online VIS framework named InstanceFormer, which is especially suitable for long and challenging videos. We propose three novel components to model short-term and long-term dependency and temporal coherence. First, we propagate the representation, location, and semantic information of prior instances to model short-term changes. Second, we propose a novel memory cross-attention in the decoder, which allows the network to look into earlier instances within a certain temporal window. Finally, we employ a temporal contrastive loss to impose coherence in the representation of an instance across all frames. Memory attention and temporal coherence are particularly beneficial to long-range dependency modeling, including challenging scenarios like occlusion. The proposed InstanceFormer outperforms previous online benchmark methods by a large margin across multiple datasets. Most importantly, InstanceFormer surpasses offline approaches for challenging and long datasets such as YouTube-VIS-2021 and OVIS. Code is available at https://github.com/rajatkoner08/InstanceFormer.

 - **Abstract**
 Computer vision techniques can help automate or partially automate clinical examination of orofacial impairments to provide accurate and objective assessments. Towards the development of such automated systems, we evaluated two approaches to detect and temporally segment (parse) repetitions in orofacial assessment videos. Recorded videos of participants with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and healthy control (HC) individuals were obtained from the Toronto NeuroFace Dataset. Two approaches for repetition detection and parsing were examined: one based on engineered features from tracked facial landmarks and peak detection in the distance between the vermilion-cutaneous junction of the upper and lower lips (baseline analysis), and another using a pre-trained transformer-based deep learning model called RepNet (Dwibedi et al, 2020), which automatically detects periodicity, and parses periodic and semi-periodic repetitions in video data. In experimental evaluation of two orofacial assessments tasks, - repeating maximum mouth opening (OPEN) and repeating the sentence "Buy Bobby a Puppy" (BBP) - RepNet provided better parsing than the landmark-based approach, quantified by higher mean intersection-over-union (IoU) with respect to ground truth manual parsing. Automated parsing using RepNet also clearly separated HC and ALS participants based on the duration of BBP repetitions, whereas the landmark-based method could not.

 - **Abstract**
 The analysis of speech measures in individuals with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) can provide essential information for early diagnosis and tracking disease progression. However, current methods for extracting speech and pause features are manual or semi-automatic, which makes them time-consuming and labour-intensive. The advent of speech-text alignment algorithms provides an opportunity for inexpensive, automated, and accurate analysis of speech measures in individuals with ALS. There is a need to validate speech and pause features calculated by these algorithms against current gold standard methods. In this study, we extracted 8 speech/pause features from 646 audio files of individuals with ALS and healthy controls performing passage reading. Two pretrained forced alignment models - one using transformers and another using a Gaussian mixture / hidden Markov architecture - were used for automatic feature extraction. The results were then validated against semi-automatic speech/pause analysis software, with further subgroup analyses based on audio quality and disease severity. Features extracted using transformer-based forced alignment had the highest agreement with gold standards, including in terms of audio quality and disease severity. This study lays the groundwork for future intelligent diagnostic support systems for clinicians, and for novel methods of tracking disease progression remotely from home.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.10630
 - **Abstract**
 With the proliferation of distributed generation into distribution networks, the need to consider fault currents in the dispatch problem becomes increasingly relevant. This paper introduces a method for adding fault current constraints into optimal power flow in order to reduce fault currents while minimizing generation cost. The optimal power flow problem is formulated as a single optimization problem with sub-networks representing the faults of interest. Having a single optimization problem allows the decision variables to be coupled across the optimal power flow and the fault current studies without having to iterate over possible solutions. The proposed method is applicable to unbalanced distribution networks, including those with transformers that introduce phase-shifts.

 - **Abstract**
 Fall detection for the elderly is a well-researched problem with several proposed solutions, including wearable and non-wearable techniques. While the existing techniques have excellent detection rates, their adoption by the target population is lacking due to the need for wearing devices and user privacy concerns. Our paper provides a novel, non-wearable, non-intrusive, and scalable solution for fall detection, deployed on an autonomous mobile robot equipped with a microphone. The proposed method uses ambient sound input recorded in people's homes. We specifically target the bathroom environment as it is highly prone to falls and where existing techniques cannot be deployed without jeopardizing user privacy. The present work develops a solution based on a Transformer architecture that takes noisy sound input from bathrooms and classifies it into fall/no-fall class with an accuracy of 0.8673. Further, the proposed approach is extendable to other indoor environments, besides bathrooms and is suitable for deploying in elderly homes, hospitals, and rehabilitation facilities without requiring the user to wear any device or be constantly "watched" by the sensors.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an effective way to predict search query-item relationship. We combine pre-trained transformer and LSTM models, and increase model robustness using adversarial training, exponential moving average, multi-sampled dropout, and diversity based ensemble, to tackle an extremely difficult problem of predicting against queries not seen before. All of our strategies focus on increasing robustness of deep learning models and are applicable in any task where deep learning models are used. Applying our strategies, we achieved 10th place in KDD Cup 2022 Product Substitution Classification task.
### MATra: A Multilingual Attentive Transliteration System for Indian  Scripts

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.10801
 - **Abstract**
 Transliteration is a task in the domain of NLP where the output word is a similar-sounding word written using the letters of any foreign language. Today this system has been developed for several language pairs that involve English as either the source or target word and deployed in several places like Google Translate and chatbots. However, there is very little research done in the field of Indic languages transliterated to other Indic languages. This paper demonstrates a multilingual model based on transformers (with some modifications) that can give noticeably higher performance and accuracy than all existing models in this domain and get much better results than state-of-the-art models. This paper shows a model that can perform transliteration between any pair among the following five languages - English, Hindi, Bengali, Kannada and Tamil. It is applicable in scenarios where language is a barrier to communication in any written task. The model beats the state-of-the-art (for all pairs among the five mentioned languages - English, Hindi, Bengali, Kannada, and Tamil) and achieves a top-1 accuracy score of 80.7%, about 29.5% higher than the best current results. Furthermore, the model achieves 93.5% in terms of Phonetic Accuracy (transliteration is primarily a phonetic/sound-based task).
### Towards Accurate Facial Landmark Detection via Cascaded Transformers

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.10808
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.10808
 - **Abstract**
 Accurate facial landmarks are essential prerequisites for many tasks related to human faces. In this paper, an accurate facial landmark detector is proposed based on cascaded transformers. We formulate facial landmark detection as a coordinate regression task such that the model can be trained end-to-end. With self-attention in transformers, our model can inherently exploit the structured relationships between landmarks, which would benefit landmark detection under challenging conditions such as large pose and occlusion. During cascaded refinement, our model is able to extract the most relevant image features around the target landmark for coordinate prediction, based on deformable attention mechanism, thus bringing more accurate alignment. In addition, we propose a novel decoder that refines image features and landmark positions simultaneously. With few parameter increasing, the detection performance improves further. Our model achieves new state-of-the-art performance on several standard facial landmark detection benchmarks, and shows good generalization ability in cross-dataset evaluation.
### Improving Personality Consistency in Conversation by Persona Extending

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.10816
 - **Abstract**
 Endowing chatbots with a consistent personality plays a vital role for agents to deliver human-like interactions. However, existing personalized approaches commonly generate responses in light of static predefined personas depicted with textual description, which may severely restrict the interactivity of human and the chatbot, especially when the agent needs to answer the query excluded in the predefined personas, which is so-called out-of-predefined persona problem (named OOP for simplicity). To alleviate the problem, in this paper we propose a novel retrieval-to-prediction paradigm consisting of two subcomponents, namely, (1) Persona Retrieval Model (PRM), it retrieves a persona from a global collection based on a Natural Language Inference (NLI) model, the inferred persona is consistent with the predefined personas; and (2) Posterior-scored Transformer (PS-Transformer), it adopts a persona posterior distribution that further considers the actual personas used in the ground response, maximally mitigating the gap between training and inferring. Furthermore, we present a dataset called IT-ConvAI2 that first highlights the OOP problem in personalized dialogue. Extensive experiments on both IT-ConvAI2 and ConvAI2 demonstrate that our proposed model yields considerable improvements in both automatic metrics and human evaluations.
### GenTUS: Simulating User Behaviour and Language in Task-oriented  Dialogues with Generative Transformers

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.10817
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.10817
 - **Abstract**
 User simulators (USs) are commonly used to train task-oriented dialogue systems (DSs) via reinforcement learning. The interactions often take place on semantic level for efficiency, but there is still a gap from semantic actions to natural language, which causes a mismatch between training and deployment environment. Incorporating a natural language generation (NLG) module with USs during training can partly deal with this problem. However, since the policy and NLG of USs are optimised separately, these simulated user utterances may not be natural enough in a given context. In this work, we propose a generative transformer-based user simulator (GenTUS). GenTUS consists of an encoder-decoder structure, which means it can optimise both the user policy and natural language generation jointly. GenTUS generates both semantic actions and natural language utterances, preserving interpretability and enhancing language variation. In addition, by representing the inputs and outputs as word sequences and by using a large pre-trained language model we can achieve generalisability in feature representation. We evaluate GenTUS with automatic metrics and human evaluation. Our results show that GenTUS generates more natural language and is able to transfer to an unseen ontology in a zero-shot fashion. In addition, its behaviour can be further shaped with reinforcement learning opening the door to training specialised user simulators.
### Enhancing User Behavior Sequence Modeling by Generative Tasks for  Session Search

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.10846
 - **Abstract**
 Users' search tasks have become increasingly complicated, requiring multiple queries and interactions with the results. Recent studies have demonstrated that modeling the historical user behaviors in a session can help understand the current search intent. Existing context-aware ranking models primarily encode the current session sequence (from the first behavior to the current query) and compute the ranking score using the high-level representations. However, there is usually some noise in the current session sequence (useless behaviors for inferring the search intent) that may affect the quality of the encoded representations. To help the encoding of the current user behavior sequence, we propose to use a decoder and the information of future sequences and a supplemental query. Specifically, we design three generative tasks that can help the encoder to infer the actual search intent: (1) predicting future queries, (2) predicting future clicked documents, and (3) predicting a supplemental query. We jointly learn the ranking task with these generative tasks using an encoder-decoder structured approach. Extensive experiments on two public search logs demonstrate that our model outperforms all existing baselines, and the designed generative tasks can actually help the ranking task. Besides, additional experiments also show that our approach can be easily applied to various Transformer-based encoder-decoder models and improve their performance.

 - **Abstract**
 Vision Transformers (ViTs) have underpinned the recent breakthroughs in computer vision. However, designing the architectures of ViTs is laborious and heavily relies on expert knowledge. To automate the design process and incorporate deployment flexibility, one-shot neural architecture search decouples the supernet training and architecture specialization for diverse deployment scenarios. To cope with an enormous number of sub-networks in the supernet, existing methods treat all architectures equally important and randomly sample some of them in each update step during training. During architecture search, these methods focus on finding architectures on the Pareto frontier of performance and resource consumption, which forms a gap between training and deployment. In this paper, we devise a simple yet effective method, called FocusFormer, to bridge such a gap. To this end, we propose to learn an architecture sampler to assign higher sampling probabilities to those architectures on the Pareto frontier under different resource constraints during supernet training, making them sufficiently optimized and hence improving their performance. During specialization, we can directly use the well-trained architecture sampler to obtain accurate architectures satisfying the given resource constraint, which significantly improves the search efficiency. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet show that our FocusFormer is able to improve the performance of the searched architectures while significantly reducing the search cost. For example, on ImageNet, our FocusFormer-Ti with 1.4G FLOPs outperforms AutoFormer-Ti by 0.5% in terms of the Top-1 accuracy.

 - **Abstract**
 Deep neural network based object detectors are continuously evolving and are used in a multitude of applications, each having its own set of requirements. While safety-critical applications need high accuracy and reliability, low-latency tasks need resource and energy-efficient networks. Real-time detectors, which are a necessity in high-impact real-world applications, are continuously proposed, but they overemphasize the improvements in accuracy and speed while other capabilities such as versatility, robustness, resource and energy efficiency are omitted. A reference benchmark for existing networks does not exist, nor does a standard evaluation guideline for designing new networks, which results in ambiguous and inconsistent comparisons. We, thus, conduct a comprehensive study on multiple real-time detectors (anchor-, keypoint-, and transformer-based) on a wide range of datasets and report results on an extensive set of metrics. We also study the impact of variables such as image size, anchor dimensions, confidence thresholds, and architecture layers on the overall performance. We analyze the robustness of detection networks against distribution shifts, natural corruptions, and adversarial attacks. Also, we provide a calibration analysis to gauge the reliability of the predictions. Finally, to highlight the real-world impact, we conduct two unique case studies, on autonomous driving and healthcare applications. To further gauge the capability of networks in critical real-time applications, we report the performance after deploying the detection networks on edge devices. Our extensive empirical study can act as a guideline for the industrial community to make an informed choice on the existing networks. We also hope to inspire the research community towards a new direction in the design and evaluation of networks that focuses on a bigger and holistic overview for a far-reaching impact.

 - **Abstract**
 Multi-modal named entity recognition (MNER) aims at identifying entity spans and recognizing their categories in social media posts with the aid of images. However, in dominant MNER approaches, the interaction of different modalities is usually carried out through the alternation of self-attention and cross-attention or over-reliance on the gating machine, which results in imprecise and biased correspondence between fine-grained semantic units of text and image. To address this issue, we propose a Flat Multi-modal Interaction Transformer (FMIT) for MNER. Specifically, we first utilize noun phrases in sentences and general domain words to obtain visual cues. Then, we transform the fine-grained semantic representation of the vision and text into a unified lattice structure and design a novel relative position encoding to match different modalities in Transformer. Meanwhile, we propose to leverage entity boundary detection as an auxiliary task to alleviate visual bias. Experiments show that our methods achieve the new state-of-the-art performance on two benchmark datasets.

 This paper tackles the problem of efficient video recognition. In this area, video transformers have recently dominated the efficiency (top-1 accuracy vs FLOPs) spectrum. At the same time, there have been some attempts in the image domain which challenge the necessity of the self-attention operation within the transformer architecture, advocating the use of simpler approaches for token mixing. However, there are no results yet for the case of video recognition, where the self-attention operator has a significantly higher impact (compared to the case of images) on efficiency. To address this gap, in this paper, we make the following contributions: (a) we construct a highly efficient \& accurate attention-free block based on the shift operator, coined Affine-Shift block, specifically designed to approximate as closely as possible the operations in the MHSA block of a Transformer layer. Based on our Affine-Shift block, we construct our Affine-Shift Transformer and show that it already outperforms all existing shift/MLP--based architectures for ImageNet classification. (b) We extend our formulation in the video domain to construct Video Affine-Shift Transformer (VAST), the very first purely attention-free shift-based video transformer. (c) We show that VAST significantly outperforms recent state-of-the-art transformers on the most popular action recognition benchmarks for the case of models with low computational and memory footprint. Code will be made available.

 Duckiebots are low-cost mobile robots that are widely used in the fields of research and education. Although there are existing self-driving algorithms for the Duckietown platform, they are either too complex or perform too poorly to navigate a multi-lane track. Moreover, it is essential to give memory and computational resources to a Duckiebot so it can perform additional tasks such as out-of-distribution input detection. In order to satisfy these constraints, we built a low-cost autonomous driving algorithm capable of driving on a two-lane track. The algorithm uses traditional computer vision techniques to identify the central lane on the track and obtain the relevant steering angle. The steering is then controlled by a PID controller that smoothens the movement of the Duckiebot. The performance of the algorithm was compared to that of the NeurIPS 2018 AI Driving Olympics (AIDO) finalists, and it outperformed all but one finalists. The two main contributions of our algorithm are its low computational requirements and very quick set-up, with ongoing efforts to make it more reliable.

 Taking into account information across the temporal domain helps to improve environment perception in autonomous driving. However, it has not been studied so far whether temporally fused neural networks are vulnerable to deliberately generated perturbations, i.e. adversarial attacks, or whether temporal history is an inherent defense against them. In this work, we study whether temporal feature networks for object detection are vulnerable to universal adversarial attacks. We evaluate attacks of two types: imperceptible noise for the whole image and locally-bound adversarial patch. In both cases, perturbations are generated in a white-box manner using PGD. Our experiments confirm, that attacking even a portion of a temporal input suffices to fool the network. We visually assess generated perturbations to gain insights into the functioning of attacks. To enhance the robustness, we apply adversarial training using 5-PGD. Our experiments on KITTI and nuScenes datasets demonstrate, that a model robustified via K-PGD is able to withstand the studied attacks while keeping the mAP-based performance comparable to that of an unattacked model.

 - **Abstract**
 Deep neural network based object detectors are continuously evolving and are used in a multitude of applications, each having its own set of requirements. While safety-critical applications need high accuracy and reliability, low-latency tasks need resource and energy-efficient networks. Real-time detectors, which are a necessity in high-impact real-world applications, are continuously proposed, but they overemphasize the improvements in accuracy and speed while other capabilities such as versatility, robustness, resource and energy efficiency are omitted. A reference benchmark for existing networks does not exist, nor does a standard evaluation guideline for designing new networks, which results in ambiguous and inconsistent comparisons. We, thus, conduct a comprehensive study on multiple real-time detectors (anchor-, keypoint-, and transformer-based) on a wide range of datasets and report results on an extensive set of metrics. We also study the impact of variables such as image size, anchor dimensions, confidence thresholds, and architecture layers on the overall performance. We analyze the robustness of detection networks against distribution shifts, natural corruptions, and adversarial attacks. Also, we provide a calibration analysis to gauge the reliability of the predictions. Finally, to highlight the real-world impact, we conduct two unique case studies, on autonomous driving and healthcare applications. To further gauge the capability of networks in critical real-time applications, we report the performance after deploying the detection networks on edge devices. Our extensive empirical study can act as a guideline for the industrial community to make an informed choice on the existing networks. We also hope to inspire the research community towards a new direction in the design and evaluation of networks that focuses on a bigger and holistic overview for a far-reaching impact.

 - **Abstract**
 Low-light video enhancement (LLVE) is an important yet challenging task with many applications such as photographing and autonomous driving. Unlike single image low-light enhancement, most LLVE methods utilize temporal information from adjacent frames to restore the color and remove the noise of the target frame. However, these algorithms, based on the framework of multi-frame alignment and enhancement, may produce multi-frame fusion artifacts when encountering extreme low light or fast motion. In this paper, inspired by the low latency and high dynamic range of events, we use synthetic events from multiple frames to guide the enhancement and restoration of low-light videos. Our method contains three stages: 1) event synthesis and enhancement, 2) event and image fusion, and 3) low-light enhancement. In this framework, we design two novel modules (event-image fusion transform and event-guided dual branch) for the second and third stages, respectively. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms existing low-light video or single image enhancement approaches on both synthetic and real LLVE datasets.
