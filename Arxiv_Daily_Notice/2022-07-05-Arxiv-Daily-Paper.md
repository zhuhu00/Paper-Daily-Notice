 - **Abstract**
 Site-specific radio frequency (RF) propagation prediction increasingly relies on models built from visual data such as cameras and LIDAR sensors. When operating in dynamic settings, the environment may only be partially observed. This paper introduces a method to extract statistical channel models, given partial observations of the surrounding environment. We propose a simple heuristic algorithm that performs ray tracing on the partial environment and then uses machine-learning trained predictors to estimate the channel and its uncertainty from features extracted from the partial ray tracing results. It is shown that the proposed method can interpolate between fully statistical models when no partial information is available and fully deterministic models when the environment is completely observed. The method can also capture the degree of uncertainty of the propagation predictions depending on the amount of region that has been explored. The methodology is demonstrated in a robotic navigation application simulated on a set of indoor maps with detailed models constructed using state-of-the-art navigation, simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), and computer vision methods.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we propose a tightly-coupled SLAM system fused with RGB, Depth, IMU and structured plane information. Traditional sparse points based SLAM systems always maintain a mass of map points to model the environment. Huge number of map points bring us a high computational complexity, making it difficult to be deployed on mobile devices. On the other hand, planes are common structures in man-made environment especially in indoor environments. We usually can use a small number of planes to represent a large scene. So the main purpose of this article is to decrease the high complexity of sparse points based SLAM. We build a lightweight back-end map which consists of a few planes and map points to achieve efficient bundle adjustment (BA) with an equal or better accuracy. We use homography constraints to eliminate the parameters of numerous plane points in the optimization and reduce the complexity of BA. We separate the parameters and measurements in homography and point-to-plane constraints and compress the measurements part to further effectively improve the speed of BA. We also integrate the plane information into the whole system to realize robust planar feature extraction, data association, and global consistent planar reconstruction. Finally, we perform an ablation study and compare our method with similar methods in simulation and real environment data. Our system achieves obvious advantages in accuracy and efficiency. Even if the plane parameters are involved in the optimization, we effectively simplify the back-end map by using planar structures. The global bundle adjustment is nearly 2 times faster than the sparse points based SLAM algorithm.

 - **Abstract**
 Event cameras have recently gained in popularity as they hold strong potential to complement regular cameras in situations of high dynamics or challenging illumination. An important problem that may benefit from the addition of an event camera is given by Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM). However, in order to ensure progress on event-inclusive multi-sensor SLAM, novel benchmark sequences are needed. Our contribution is the first complete set of benchmark datasets captured with a multi-sensor setup containing an event-based stereo camera, a regular stereo camera, multiple depth sensors, and an inertial measurement unit. The setup is fully hardware-synchronized and underwent accurate extrinsic calibration. All sequences come with ground truth data captured by highly accurate external reference devices such as a motion capture system. Individual sequences include both small and large-scale environments, and cover the specific challenges targeted by dynamic vision sensors.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, an approach for reducing the drift in monocular visual odometry algorithms is proposed based on a feedforward neural network. A visual odometry algorithm computes the incremental motion of the vehicle between the successive camera frames, then integrates these increments to determine the pose of the vehicle. The proposed neural network reduces the errors in the pose estimation of the vehicle which results from the inaccuracies in features detection and matching, camera intrinsic parameters, and so on. These inaccuracies are propagated to the motion estimation of the vehicle causing larger amounts of estimation errors. The drift reducing neural network identifies such errors based on the motion of features in the successive camera frames leading to more accurate incremental motion estimates. The proposed drift reducing neural network is trained and validated using the KITTI dataset and the results show the efficacy of the proposed approach in reducing the errors in the incremental orientation estimation, thus reducing the overall error in the pose estimation.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a novel panoptic visual odometry framework, termed PVO, to achieve a more comprehensive modeling of the scene's motion, geometry, and panoptic segmentation information. PVO models visual odometry (VO) and video panoptic segmentation (VPS) in a unified view, enabling the two tasks to facilitate each other. Specifically, we introduce a panoptic update module into the VO module, which operates on the image panoptic segmentation. This Panoptic-Enhanced VO module can trim the interference of dynamic objects in the camera pose estimation by adjusting the weights of optimized camera poses. On the other hand, the VO-Enhanced VPS module improves the segmentation accuracy by fusing the panoptic segmentation result of the current frame on the fly to the adjacent frames, using geometric information such as camera pose, depth, and optical flow obtained from the VO module. These two modules contribute to each other through a recurrent iterative optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PVO outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both visual odometry and video panoptic segmentation tasks. Code and data are available on the project webpage: \urlstyle{tt} \textcolor{url_color}{\url{https://zju3dv.github.io/pvo/}}.

 - **Abstract**
 Despite significant academic and corporate efforts, autonomous driving under adverse visual conditions still proves challenging. As neuromorphic technology has matured, its application to robotics and autonomous vehicle systems has become an area of active research. Low-light and latency-demanding situations can benefit. To enable event cameras to operate alongside staple sensors like lidar in perception tasks, we propose a direct, temporally-decoupled calibration method between event cameras and lidars. The high dynamic range and low-light operation of event cameras are exploited to directly register lidar laser returns, allowing information-based correlation methods to optimize for the 6-DoF extrinsic calibration between the two sensors. This paper presents the first direct calibration method between event cameras and lidars, removing dependencies on frame-based camera intermediaries and/or highly-accurate hand measurements. Code will be made publicly available.

 - **Abstract**
 In this article we propose a reactive constrained navigation scheme, with embedded obstacles avoidance for an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), for enabling navigation in obstacle-dense environments. The proposed navigation architecture is based on Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC), and utilizes an on-board 2D LiDAR to detect obstacles and translate online the key geometric information of the environment into parametric constraints for the NMPC that constrain the available position-space for the UAV. This article focuses also on the real-world implementation and experimental validation of the proposed reactive navigation scheme, and it is applied in multiple challenging laboratory experiments, where we also conduct comparisons with relevant methods of reactive obstacle avoidance. The solver utilized in the proposed approach is the Optimization Engine (OpEn) and the Proximal Averaged Newton for Optimal Control (PANOC) algorithm, where a penalty method is applied to properly consider obstacles and input constraints during the navigation task. The proposed novel scheme allows for fast solutions, while using limited on-board computational power, that is a required feature for the overall closed loop performance of an UAV and is applied in multiple real-time scenarios. The combination of built-in obstacle avoidance and real-time applicability makes the proposed reactive constrained navigation scheme an elegant framework for UAVs that is able to perform fast nonlinear control, local path-planning and obstacle avoidance, all embedded in the control layer.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.01452
 - **Abstract**
 Current methods for LIDAR semantic segmentation are not robust enough for real-world applications, e.g., autonomous driving, since it is closed-set and static. The closed-set assumption makes the network only able to output labels of trained classes, even for objects never seen before, while a static network cannot update its knowledge base according to what it has seen. Therefore, in this work, we propose the open-world semantic segmentation task for LIDAR point clouds, which aims to 1) identify both old and novel classes using open-set semantic segmentation, and 2) gradually incorporate novel objects into the existing knowledge base using incremental learning without forgetting old classes. For this purpose, we propose a REdundAncy cLassifier (REAL) framework to provide a general architecture for both the open-set semantic segmentation and incremental learning problems. The experimental results show that REAL can simultaneously achieves state-of-the-art performance in the open-set semantic segmentation task on the SemanticKITTI and nuScenes datasets, and alleviate the catastrophic forgetting problem with a large margin during incremental learning.

 - **Abstract**
 Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) regresses a neural parameterized scene by differentially rendering multi-view images with ground-truth supervision. However, when interpolating novel views, NeRF often yields inconsistent and visually non-smooth geometric results, which we consider as a generalization gap between seen and unseen views. Recent advances in convolutional neural networks have demonstrated the promise of advanced robust data augmentations, either random or learned, in enhancing both in-distribution and out-of-distribution generalization. Inspired by that, we propose Augmented NeRF (Aug-NeRF), which for the first time brings the power of robust data augmentations into regularizing the NeRF training. Particularly, our proposal learns to seamlessly blend worst-case perturbations into three distinct levels of the NeRF pipeline with physical grounds, including (1) the input coordinates, to simulate imprecise camera parameters at image capture; (2) intermediate features, to smoothen the intrinsic feature manifold; and (3) pre-rendering output, to account for the potential degradation factors in the multi-view image supervision. Extensive results demonstrate that Aug-NeRF effectively boosts NeRF performance in both novel view synthesis (up to 1.5dB PSNR gain) and underlying geometry reconstruction. Furthermore, thanks to the implicit smooth prior injected by the triple-level augmentations, Aug-NeRF can even recover scenes from heavily corrupted images, a highly challenging setting untackled before. Our codes are available in https://github.com/VITA-Group/Aug-NeRF.

 - **Abstract**
 Obtaining 3D object representations is important for creating photo-realistic simulators and collecting assets for AR/VR applications. Neural fields have shown their effectiveness in learning a continuous volumetric representation of a scene from 2D images, but acquiring object representations from these models with weak supervision remains an open challenge. In this paper we introduce LaTeRF, a method for extracting an object of interest from a scene given 2D images of the entire scene and known camera poses, a natural language description of the object, and a small number of point-labels of object and non-object points in the input images. To faithfully extract the object from the scene, LaTeRF extends the NeRF formulation with an additional `objectness' probability at each 3D point. Additionally, we leverage the rich latent space of a pre-trained CLIP model combined with our differentiable object renderer, to inpaint the occluded parts of the object. We demonstrate high-fidelity object extraction on both synthetic and real datasets and justify our design choices through an extensive ablation study.

 - **Abstract**
 Natural language is an intuitive way for humans to communicate tasks to a robot. While natural language (NL) is ambiguous, real world tasks and their safety requirements need to be communicated unambiguously. Signal Temporal Logic (STL) is a formal logic that can serve as a versatile, expressive, and unambiguous formal language to describe robotic tasks. On one hand, existing work in using STL for the robotics domain typically requires end-users to express task specifications in STL, a challenge for non-expert users. On the other, translating from NL to STL specifications is currently restricted to specific fragments. In this work, we propose DIALOGUESTL, an interactive approach for learning correct and concise STL formulas from (often) ambiguous NL descriptions. We use a combination of semantic parsing, pre-trained transformer-based language models, and user-in-the-loop clarifications aided by a small number of user demonstrations to predict the best STL formula to encode NL task descriptions. An advantage of mapping NL to STL is that there has been considerable recent work on the use of reinforcement learning (RL) to identify control policies for robots. We show we can use Deep Q-Learning techniques to learn optimal policies from the learned STL specifications. We demonstrate that DIALOGUESTL is efficient, scalable, and robust, and has high accuracy in predicting the correct STL formula with a few number of demonstrations and a few interactions with an oracle user.
### Human-Assisted Robotic Detection of Foreign Object Debris Inside  Confined Spaces of Marine Vessels Using Probabilistic Mapping

 - **Abstract**
 Many complex vehicular systems, such as large marine vessels, contain confined spaces like water tanks, which are critical for the safe functioning of the vehicles. It is particularly hazardous for humans to inspect such spaces due to limited accessibility, poor visibility, and unstructured configuration. While robots provide a viable alternative, they encounter the same set of challenges in realizing robust autonomy. In this work, we specifically address the problem of detecting foreign object debris (FODs) left inside the confined spaces using a visual mapping-based system that relies on Mahalanobis distance-driven comparisons between the nominal and online maps for local outlier identification. Simulation trials show extremely high recall but low precision for the outlier identification method. The assistance of remote humans is, therefore, taken to deal with the precision problem by going over the close-up robot camera images of the outlier regions. An online survey is conducted to show the usefulness of this assistance process. Physical experiments are also reported on a GPU-enabled mobile robot platform inside a scaled-down, prototype tank to demonstrate the feasibility of the FOD detection system.

 - **Abstract**
 Search and retrieval remains a major research topic in several domains, including computer graphics, computer vision, engineering design, etc. A search engine requires primarily an input search query and a database of items to search from. In engineering, which is the primary context of this paper, the database consists of 3D CAD models, such as washers, pistons, connecting rods, etc. A query from a user is typically in the form of a sketch, which attempts to capture the details of a 3D model. However, sketches have certain typical defects such as gaps, over-drawn portions (multi-strokes), etc. Since the retrieved results are only as good as the input query, sketches need cleaning-up and enhancement for better retrieval results. In this paper, a deep learning approach is proposed to improve or clean the query sketches. Initially, sketches from various categories are analysed in order to understand the many possible defects that may occur. A dataset of cleaned-up or enhanced query sketches is then created based on an understanding of these defects. Consequently, an end-to-end training of a deep neural network is carried out in order to provide a mapping between the defective and the clean sketches. This network takes the defective query sketch as the input and generates a clean or an enhanced query sketch. Qualitative and quantitative comparisons of the proposed approach with other state-of-the-art techniques show that the proposed approach is effective. The results of the search engine are reported using both the defective and enhanced query sketches, and it is shown that using the enhanced query sketches from the developed approach yields improved search results.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.00876
 - **Abstract**
 There are a few challenges related to the task of biomedical named entity recognition, which are: the existing methods consider a fewer number of biomedical entities (e.g., disease, symptom, proteins, genes); and these methods do not consider the social determinants of health (age, gender, employment, race), which are the non-medical factors related to patients' health. We propose a machine learning pipeline that improves on previous efforts in the following ways: first, it recognizes many biomedical entity types other than the standard ones; second, it considers non-clinical factors related to patient's health. This pipeline also consists of stages, such as preprocessing, tokenization, mapping embedding lookup and named entity recognition task to extract biomedical named entities from the free texts. We present a new dataset that we prepare by curating the COVID-19 case reports. The proposed approach outperforms the baseline methods on five benchmark datasets with macro-and micro-average F1 scores around 90, as well as our dataset with a macro-and micro-average F1 score of 95.25 and 93.18 respectively.

 - **Abstract**
 As one of the most widely used metal tube bending methods, the rotary draw bending (RDB) process enables reliable and high-precision metal tube bending forming (MTBF). The forming accuracy is seriously affected by the springback and other potential forming defects, of which the mechanism analysis is difficult to deal with. At the same time, the existing methods are mainly conducted in offline space, ignoring the real-time information in the physical world, which is unreliable and inefficient. To address this issue, a digital-twin-enhanced (DT-enhanced) metal tube bending forming real-time prediction method based on multi-source-input multi-task learning (MTL) is proposed. The new method can achieve comprehensive MTBF real-time prediction. By sharing the common feature of the multi-close domain and adopting group regularization strategy on feature sharing and accepting layers, the accuracy and efficiency of the multi-source-input MTL can be guaranteed. Enhanced by DT, the physical real-time deformation data is aligned in the image dimension by an improved Grammy Angle Field (GAF) conversion, realizing the reflection of the actual processing. Different from the traditional offline prediction methods, the new method integrates the virtual and physical data to achieve a more efficient and accurate real-time prediction result. and the DT mapping connection between virtual and physical systems can be achieved. To exclude the effects of equipment errors, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified on the physical experiment-verified FE simulation scenarios. At the same time, the common pre-training networks are compared with the proposed method. The results show that the proposed DT-enhanced prediction method is more accurate and efficient.

 - **Abstract**
 Optimal transport (OT) provides effective tools for comparing and mapping probability measures. We propose to leverage the flexibility of neural networks to learn an approximate optimal transport map. More precisely, we present a new and original method to address the problem of transporting a finite set of samples associated with a first underlying unknown distribution towards another finite set of samples drawn from another unknown distribution. We show that a particular instance of invertible neural networks, namely the normalizing flows, can be used to approximate the solution of this OT problem between a pair of empirical distributions. To this aim, we propose to relax the Monge formulation of OT by replacing the equality constraint on the push-forward measure by the minimization of the corresponding Wasserstein distance. The push-forward operator to be retrieved is then restricted to be a normalizing flow which is trained by optimizing the resulting cost function. This approach allows the transport map to be discretized as a composition of functions. Each of these functions is associated to one sub-flow of the network, whose output provides intermediate steps of the transport between the original and target measures. This discretization yields also a set of intermediate barycenters between the two measures of interest. Experiments conducted on toy examples as well as a challenging task of unsupervised translation demonstrate the interest of the proposed method. Finally, some experiments show that the proposed approach leads to a good approximation of the true OT.
### Model-Free 3D Shape Control of Deformable Objects Using Novel Features  Based on Modal Analysis

 - **Abstract**
 Shape control of deformable objects is a challenging and important robotic problem. This paper proposes a model-free controller using novel 3D global deformation features based on modal analysis. Unlike most existing controllers using geometric features, our controller employs a physically-based deformation feature by decoupling 3D global deformation into low-frequency mode shapes. Although modal analysis is widely adopted in computer vision and simulation, it has not been used in robotic deformation control. We develop a new model-free framework for modal-based deformation control under robot manipulation. Physical interpretation of mode shapes enables us to formulate an analytical deformation Jacobian matrix mapping the robot manipulation onto changes of the modal features. In the Jacobian matrix, unknown geometry and physical properties of the object are treated as low-dimensional modal parameters which can be used to linearly parameterize the closed-loop system. Thus, an adaptive controller with proven stability can be designed to deform the object while online estimating the modal parameters. Simulations and experiments are conducted using linear, planar, and solid objects under different settings. The results not only confirm the superior performance of our controller but also demonstrate its advantages over the baseline method.

 - **Abstract**
 Generative model-based motion prediction techniques have recently realized predicting controlled human motions, such as predicting multiple upper human body motions with similar lower-body motions. However, to achieve this, the state-of-the-art methods require either subsequently learning mapping functions to seek similar motions or training the model repetitively to enable control over the desired portion of body. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to learn disentangled representations for controllable human motion prediction. Our network involves a conditional variational auto-encoder (CVAE) architecture to model full-body human motion, and an extra CVAE path to learn only the corresponding partial-body (e.g., lower-body) motion. Specifically, the inductive bias imposed by the extra CVAE path encourages two latent variables in two paths to respectively govern separate representations for each partial-body motion. With a single training, our model is able to provide two types of controls for the generated human motions: (i) strictly controlling one portion of human body and (ii) adaptively controlling the other portion, by sampling from a pair of latent spaces. Additionally, we extend and adapt a sampling strategy to our trained model to diversify the controllable predictions. Our framework also potentially allows new forms of control by flexibly customizing the input for the extra CVAE path. Extensive experimental results and ablation studies demonstrate that our approach is capable of predicting state-of-the-art controllable human motions both qualitatively and quantitatively.

 - **Abstract**
 Event cameras have recently gained in popularity as they hold strong potential to complement regular cameras in situations of high dynamics or challenging illumination. An important problem that may benefit from the addition of an event camera is given by Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM). However, in order to ensure progress on event-inclusive multi-sensor SLAM, novel benchmark sequences are needed. Our contribution is the first complete set of benchmark datasets captured with a multi-sensor setup containing an event-based stereo camera, a regular stereo camera, multiple depth sensors, and an inertial measurement unit. The setup is fully hardware-synchronized and underwent accurate extrinsic calibration. All sequences come with ground truth data captured by highly accurate external reference devices such as a motion capture system. Individual sequences include both small and large-scale environments, and cover the specific challenges targeted by dynamic vision sensors.

Thus, institutions consider Authenticity Enhancing Technologies (AETs) and Privacy-Enhancing Technologies (PETs) to engage in Sovereign Data Exchange (SDE), i.e., sharing data with third parties without compromising their own or their users' data sovereignty. However, these technologies are often technically complex, which impedes their adoption. To support practitioners select PETs and AETs for SDE use cases and highlight SDE challenges researchers and practitioners should address, this study empirically constructs a challenge-oriented technology mapping. First, we compile challenges of SDE by conducting a systematic literature review and expert interviews. Second, we map PETs and AETs to the SDE challenges and identify which technologies can mitigate which challenges. We validate the mapping through investigator triangulation. Although the most critical challenge concerns data usage and access control, we find that the majority of PETs and AETs focus on data processing issues.

 - **Abstract**
 Knowledge Graph Completion has been widely studied recently to complete missing elements within triples via mainly modeling graph structural features, but performs sensitive to the sparsity of graph structure. Relevant texts like entity names and descriptions, acting as another expression form for Knowledge Graphs (KGs), are expected to solve this challenge. Several methods have been proposed to utilize both structure and text messages with two encoders, but only achieved limited improvements due to the failure to balance weights between them. And reserving both structural and textual encoders during inference also suffers from heavily overwhelmed parameters. Motivated by Knowledge Distillation, we view knowledge as mappings from input to output probabilities and propose a plug-and-play framework VEM2L over sparse KGs to fuse knowledge extracted from text and structure messages into a unity. Specifically, we partition knowledge acquired by models into two nonoverlapping parts: one part is relevant to the fitting capacity upon training triples, which could be fused by motivating two encoders to learn from each other on training sets; the other reflects the generalization ability upon unobserved queries. And correspondingly, we propose a new fusion strategy proved by Variational EM algorithm to fuse the generalization ability of models, during which we also apply graph densification operations to further alleviate the sparse graph problem. By combining these two fusion methods, we propose VEM2L framework finally. Both detailed theoretical evidence, as well as quantitative and qualitative experiments, demonstrates the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed framework.

 - **Abstract**
 Mid-air haptics create a new mode of feedback to allow people to feel tactile sensations in the air. Ultrasonic arrays focus acoustic radiation pressure in space, to induce tactile sensation from the resulting skin deflection. In this work, we present a low-cost tactile robot to test mid-air haptics. By combining a desktop robot arm with a 3D-printed biomimetic tactile sensor, we developed a system that can sense, map, and visualize mid-air haptic sensations created by an ultrasonic transducer array. We evaluate our tactile robot by testing it on a variety of mid-air haptic stimuli, including unmodulated and modulated focal points that create a range of haptic shapes. We compare the mapping of the stimuli to another method used to test mid-air haptics: Laser Doppler Vibrometry, highlighting the advantages of the tactile robot including far lower cost, a small lightweight form-factor, and ease-of-use. Overall, these findings indicate our method has multiple benefits for sensing mid-air haptics and opens up new possibilities for expanding the testing to better emulate human haptic perception.

 - **Abstract**
 Learning to evaluate and improve policies is a core problem of Reinforcement Learning (RL). Traditional RL algorithms learn a value function defined for a single policy. A recently explored competitive alternative is to learn a single value function for many policies. Here we combine the actor-critic architecture of Parameter-Based Value Functions and the policy embedding of Policy Evaluation Networks to learn a single value function for evaluating (and thus helping to improve) any policy represented by a deep neural network (NN). The method yields competitive experimental results. In continuous control problems with infinitely many states, our value function minimizes its prediction error by simultaneously learning a small set of `probing states' and a mapping from actions produced in probing states to the policy's return. The method extracts crucial abstract knowledge about the environment in form of very few states sufficient to fully specify the behavior of many policies. A policy improves solely by changing actions in probing states, following the gradient of the value function's predictions. Surprisingly, it is possible to clone the behavior of a near-optimal policy in Swimmer-v3 and Hopper-v3 environments only by knowing how to act in 3 and 5 such learned states, respectively. Remarkably, our value function trained to evaluate NN policies is also invariant to changes of the policy architecture: we show that it allows for zero-shot learning of linear policies competitive with the best policy seen during training. Our code is public.

 - **Abstract**
 The quality of industrial components is critical to the production of special equipment such as robots. Defect inspection of these components is an efficient way to ensure quality. In this paper, we propose a hybrid network, SSD-Faster Net, for industrial defect inspection of rails, insulators, commutators etc. SSD-Faster Net is a two-stage network, including SSD for quickly locating defective blocks, and an improved Faster R-CNN for defect segmentation. For the former, we propose a novel slice localization mechanism to help SSD scan quickly. The second stage is based on improved Faster R-CNN, using FPN, deformable kernel(DK) to enhance representation ability. It fuses multi-scale information, and self-adapts the receptive field. We also propose a novel loss function and use ROI Align to improve accuracy. Experiments show that our SSD-Faster Net achieves an average accuracy of 84.03%, which is 13.42% higher than the nearest competitor based on Faster R-CNN, 4.14% better than GAN-based methods, more than 10% higher than that of DNN-based detectors. And the computing speed is improved by nearly 7%, which proves its robustness and superior performance.

 - **Abstract**
 Camouflaged object detection (COD), segmenting objects that are elegantly blended into their surroundings, is a valuable yet challenging task. Existing deep-learning methods often fall into the difficulty of accurately identifying the camouflaged object with complete and fine object structure. To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel boundary-guided network (BGNet) for camouflaged object detection. Our method explores valuable and extra object-related edge semantics to guide representation learning of COD, which forces the model to generate features that highlight object structure, thereby promoting camouflaged object detection of accurate boundary localization. Extensive experiments on three challenging benchmark datasets demonstrate that our BGNet significantly outperforms the existing 18 state-of-the-art methods under four widely-used evaluation metrics. Our code is publicly available at: https://github.com/thograce/BGNet.

 - **Abstract**
 Site-specific radio frequency (RF) propagation prediction increasingly relies on models built from visual data such as cameras and LIDAR sensors. When operating in dynamic settings, the environment may only be partially observed. This paper introduces a method to extract statistical channel models, given partial observations of the surrounding environment. We propose a simple heuristic algorithm that performs ray tracing on the partial environment and then uses machine-learning trained predictors to estimate the channel and its uncertainty from features extracted from the partial ray tracing results. It is shown that the proposed method can interpolate between fully statistical models when no partial information is available and fully deterministic models when the environment is completely observed. The method can also capture the degree of uncertainty of the propagation predictions depending on the amount of region that has been explored. The methodology is demonstrated in a robotic navigation application simulated on a set of indoor maps with detailed models constructed using state-of-the-art navigation, simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), and computer vision methods.

 - **Abstract**
 To boost a detector for single-frame 3D object detection, we present a new approach to train it to simulate features and responses following a detector trained on multi-frame point clouds. Our approach needs multi-frame point clouds only when training the single-frame detector, and once trained, it can detect objects with only single-frame point clouds as inputs during the inference. We design a novel Simulated Multi-Frame Single-Stage object Detector (SMF-SSD) framework to realize the approach: multi-view dense object fusion to densify ground-truth objects to generate a multi-frame point cloud; self-attention voxel distillation to facilitate one-to-many knowledge transfer from multi- to single-frame voxels; multi-scale BEV feature distillation to transfer knowledge in low-level spatial and high-level semantic BEV features; and adaptive response distillation to activate single-frame responses of high confidence and accurate localization. Experimental results on the Waymo test set show that our SMF-SSD consistently outperforms all state-of-the-art single-frame 3D object detectors for all object classes of difficulty levels 1 and 2 in terms of both mAP and mAPH.

 Generally pre-training and long-time training computation are necessary for obtaining a good-performance text detector based on deep networks. In this paper, we present a new scene text detection network (called FANet) with a Fast convergence speed and Accurate text localization. The proposed FANet is an end-to-end text detector based on transformer feature learning and normalized Fourier descriptor modeling, where the Fourier Descriptor Proposal Network and Iterative Text Decoding Network are designed to efficiently and accurately identify text proposals. Additionally, a Dense Matching Strategy and a well-designed loss function are also proposed for optimizing the network performance. Extensive experiments are carried out to demonstrate that the proposed FANet can achieve the SOTA performance with fewer training epochs and no pre-training. When we introduce additional data for pre-training, the proposed FANet can achieve SOTA performance on MSRATD500, CTW1500 and TotalText. The ablation experiments also verify the effectiveness of our contributions.

 - **Abstract**
 Event cameras have recently gained in popularity as they hold strong potential to complement regular cameras in situations of high dynamics or challenging illumination. An important problem that may benefit from the addition of an event camera is given by Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM). However, in order to ensure progress on event-inclusive multi-sensor SLAM, novel benchmark sequences are needed. Our contribution is the first complete set of benchmark datasets captured with a multi-sensor setup containing an event-based stereo camera, a regular stereo camera, multiple depth sensors, and an inertial measurement unit. The setup is fully hardware-synchronized and underwent accurate extrinsic calibration. All sequences come with ground truth data captured by highly accurate external reference devices such as a motion capture system. Individual sequences include both small and large-scale environments, and cover the specific challenges targeted by dynamic vision sensors.

 - **Abstract**
 With increasing digitalization, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is becoming ubiquitous. AI-based systems to identify, optimize, automate, and scale solutions to complex economic and societal problems are being proposed and implemented. This has motivated regulation efforts, including the Proposal of an EU AI Act. This interdisciplinary position paper considers various concerns surrounding fairness and discrimination in AI, and discusses how AI regulations address them, focusing on (but not limited to) the Proposal. We first look at AI and fairness through the lenses of law, (AI) industry, sociotechnology, and (moral) philosophy, and present various perspectives. Then, we map these perspectives along three axes of interests: (i) Standardization vs. Localization, (ii) Utilitarianism vs. Egalitarianism, and (iii) Consequential vs. Deontological ethics which leads us to identify a pattern of common arguments and tensions between these axes. Positioning the discussion within the axes of interest and with a focus on reconciling the key tensions, we identify and propose the roles AI Regulation should take to make the endeavor of the AI Act a success in terms of AI fairness concerns.
### Beyond mAP: Re-evaluating and Improving Performance in Instance  Segmentation with Semantic Sorting and Contrastive Flow

 - **Abstract**
 Top-down instance segmentation methods improve mAP by hedging bets on low-confidence predictions to match a ground truth. Moreover, the query-key paradigm of top-down methods leads to the instance merging problem. An excessive number of duplicate predictions leads to the (over)counting error, and the independence of category and localization branches leads to the naming error. The de-facto mAP metric doesn't capture these errors, as we show that a trivial dithering scheme can simultaneously increase mAP with hedging errors. To this end, we propose two graph-based metrics that quantifies the amount of hedging both inter-and intra-class. We conjecture the source of the hedging problem is due to feature merging and propose a) Contrastive Flow Field to encode contextual differences between instances as a supervisory signal, and b) Semantic Sorting and NMS step to suppress duplicates and incorrectly categorized prediction. Ablations show that our method encodes contextual information better than baselines, and experiments on COCO our method simultaneously reduces merging and hedging errors compared to state-of-the-art instance segmentation methods.

 - **Abstract**
 Dynamic graphs refer to graphs whose structure dynamically changes over time. Despite the benefits of learning vertex representations (i.e., embeddings) for dynamic graphs, existing works merely view a dynamic graph as a sequence of changes within the vertex connections, neglecting the crucial asynchronous nature of such dynamics where the evolution of each local structure starts at different times and lasts for various durations. To maintain asynchronous structural evolutions within the graph, we innovatively formulate dynamic graphs as temporal edge sequences associated with joining time of vertices (ToV) and timespan of edges (ToE). Then, a time-aware Transformer is proposed to embed vertices' dynamic connections and ToEs into the learned vertex representations. Meanwhile, we treat each edge sequence as a whole and embed its ToV of the first vertex to further encode the time-sensitive information. Extensive evaluations on several datasets show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art in a wide range of graph mining tasks. At the same time, it is very efficient and scalable for embedding large-scale dynamic graphs.

 - **Abstract**
 Emergency Departments (EDs) are a fundamental element of the Portuguese National Health Service, serving as an entry point for users with diverse and very serious medical problems. Due to the inherent characteristics of the ED; forecasting the number of patients using the services is particularly challenging. And a mismatch between the affluence and the number of medical professionals can lead to a decrease in the quality of the services provided and create problems that have repercussions for the entire hospital, with the requisition of health care workers from other departments and the postponement of surgeries. ED overcrowding is driven, in part, by non-urgent patients, that resort to emergency services despite not having a medical emergency and which represent almost half of the total number of daily patients. This paper describes a novel deep learning architecture, the Temporal Fusion Transformer, that uses calendar and time-series covariates to forecast prediction intervals and point predictions for a 4 week period. We have concluded that patient volume can be forecasted with a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 5.90% for Portugal's Health Regional Areas (HRA) and a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 84.4102 people/day. The paper shows empirical evidence supporting the use of a multivariate approach with static and time-series covariates while surpassing other models commonly found in the literature.

 - **Abstract**
 Natural language is an intuitive way for humans to communicate tasks to a robot. While natural language (NL) is ambiguous, real world tasks and their safety requirements need to be communicated unambiguously. Signal Temporal Logic (STL) is a formal logic that can serve as a versatile, expressive, and unambiguous formal language to describe robotic tasks. On one hand, existing work in using STL for the robotics domain typically requires end-users to express task specifications in STL, a challenge for non-expert users. On the other, translating from NL to STL specifications is currently restricted to specific fragments. In this work, we propose DIALOGUESTL, an interactive approach for learning correct and concise STL formulas from (often) ambiguous NL descriptions. We use a combination of semantic parsing, pre-trained transformer-based language models, and user-in-the-loop clarifications aided by a small number of user demonstrations to predict the best STL formula to encode NL task descriptions. An advantage of mapping NL to STL is that there has been considerable recent work on the use of reinforcement learning (RL) to identify control policies for robots. We show we can use Deep Q-Learning techniques to learn optimal policies from the learned STL specifications. We demonstrate that DIALOGUESTL is efficient, scalable, and robust, and has high accuracy in predicting the correct STL formula with a few number of demonstrations and a few interactions with an oracle user.

 - **Abstract**
 Self-supervised Transformer based models, such as wav2vec 2.0 and HuBERT, have produced significant improvements over existing approaches to automatic speech recognition (ASR). This is evident in the performance of the wav2vec 2.0 based pretrained XLSR-53 model across many languages when fine-tuned with available labeled data. However, the performance from finetuning these models can be dependent on the amount of in-language or similar-to-in-language data included in the pretraining dataset. In this paper we investigate continued pretraining (CoPT) with unlabeled in-language audio data on the XLSR-53 pretrained model in several low-resource languages. CoPT is more computationally efficient than semi-supervised training (SST), the standard approach of utilizing unlabeled data in ASR, since it omits the need for pseudo-labeling of the unlabeled data. We show CoPT results in word error rates (WERs), equal to or slightly better than using SST. In addition, we show that using the CoPT model for pseudo-labeling, and using these labels in SST, results in further improvements in WER.

 - **Abstract**
 We prove that transformer neural networks with logarithmic precision in the input length (and where the feedforward subnetworks are computable using linear space in their input length) can be simulated by constant-depth uniform threshold circuits. Thus, such transformers only recognize formal languages in $\mathsf{TC}^0$, the class of languages defined by constant-depth, poly-size threshold circuits. This demonstrates a connection between a practical claim in NLP and a theoretical conjecture in computational complexity theory: "attention is all you need" (Vaswani et al., 2017), i.e., transformers are capable of all efficient computation, only if all efficiently computable problems can be solved with log space, i.e., $\mathsf L = \mathsf P$. We also construct a transformer that can evaluate any constant-depth threshold circuit on any input, proving that transformers can follow instructions that are representable in $\mathsf{TC}^0$.

 - **Abstract**
 Recently, the cross-modal pre-training task has been a hotspot because of its wide application in various down-streaming researches including retrieval, captioning, question answering and so on. However, exiting methods adopt a one-stream pre-training model to explore the united vision-language representation for conducting cross-modal retrieval, which easily suffer from the calculation explosion. Moreover, although the conventional double-stream structures are quite efficient, they still lack the vital cross-modal interactions, resulting in low performances. Motivated by these challenges, we put forward a Contrastive Cross-Modal Knowledge Sharing Pre-training (COOKIE) to grasp the joint text-image representations. Structurally, COOKIE adopts the traditional double-stream structure because of the acceptable time consumption. To overcome the inherent defects of double-stream structure as mentioned above, we elaborately design two effective modules. Concretely, the first module is a weight-sharing transformer that builds on the head of the visual and textual encoders, aiming to semantically align text and image. This design enables visual and textual paths focus on the same semantics. The other one is three specially designed contrastive learning, aiming to share knowledge between different models. The shared cross-modal knowledge develops the study of unimodal representation greatly, promoting the single-modal retrieval tasks. Extensive experimental results on multi-modal matching researches that includes cross-modal retrieval, text matching, and image retrieval reveal the superiors in calculation efficiency and statistical indicators of our pre-training model.

 - **Abstract**
 This work proposes a transformer architecture for user-level classification of gambling addiction and depression that is trainable end-to-end. As opposed to other methods that operate at the post level, we process a set of social media posts from a particular individual, to make use of the interactions between posts and eliminate label noise at the post level. We exploit the fact that, by not injecting positional encodings, multi-head attention is permutation invariant and we process randomly sampled sets of texts from a user after being encoded with a modern pretrained sentence encoder (RoBERTa / MiniLM). Moreover, our architecture is interpretable with modern feature attribution methods and allows for automatic dataset creation by identifying discriminating posts in a user's text-set. We perform ablation studies on hyper-parameters and evaluate our method for the eRisk 2022 Lab on early detection of signs of pathological gambling and early risk detection of depression. The method proposed by our team BLUE obtained the best ERDE5 score of 0.015, and the second-best ERDE50 score of 0.009 for pathological gambling detection. For the early detection of depression, we obtained the second-best ERDE50 of 0.027.

 - **Abstract**
 Few-shot fine-grained learning aims to classify a query image into one of a set of support categories with fine-grained differences. Although learning different objects' local differences via Deep Neural Networks has achieved success, how to exploit the query-support cross-image object semantic relations in Transformer-based architecture remains under-explored in the few-shot fine-grained scenario. In this work, we propose a Transformer-based double-helix model, namely HelixFormer, to achieve the cross-image object semantic relation mining in a bidirectional and symmetrical manner. The HelixFormer consists of two steps: 1) Relation Mining Process (RMP) across different branches, and 2) Representation Enhancement Process (REP) within each individual branch. By the designed RMP, each branch can extract fine-grained object-level Cross-image Semantic Relation Maps (CSRMs) using information from the other branch, ensuring better cross-image interaction in semantically related local object regions. Further, with the aid of CSRMs, the developed REP can strengthen the extracted features for those discovered semantically-related local regions in each branch, boosting the model's ability to distinguish subtle feature differences of fine-grained objects. Extensive experiments conducted on five public fine-grained benchmarks demonstrate that HelixFormer can effectively enhance the cross-image object semantic relation matching for recognizing fine-grained objects, achieving much better performance over most state-of-the-art methods under 1-shot and 5-shot scenarios.

 - **Abstract**
 Task-oriented dialogue systems often employ a Dialogue State Tracker (DST) to successfully complete conversations. Recent state-of-the-art DST implementations rely on schemata of diverse services to improve model robustness and handle zero-shot generalization to new domains [1], however such methods [2, 3] typically require multiple large scale transformer models and long input sequences to perform well. We propose a single multi-task BERT-based model that jointly solves the three DST tasks of intent prediction, requested slot prediction and slot filling. Moreover, we propose an efficient and parsimonious encoding of the dialogue history and service schemata that is shown to further improve performance. Evaluation on the SGD dataset shows that our approach outperforms the baseline SGP-DST by a large margin and performs well compared to the state-of-the-art, while being significantly more computationally efficient. Extensive ablation studies are performed to examine the contributing factors to the success of our model.

 - **Abstract**
 Transformer-based models have demonstrated their effectiveness in automatic speech recognition (ASR) tasks and even shown superior performance over the conventional hybrid framework. The main idea of Transformers is to capture the long-range global context within an utterance by self-attention layers. However, for scenarios like conversational speech, such utterance-level modeling will neglect contextual dependencies that span across utterances. In this paper, we propose to explicitly model the inter-sentential information in a Transformer based end-to-end architecture for conversational speech recognition. Specifically, for the encoder network, we capture the contexts of previous speech and incorporate such historic information into current input by a context-aware residual attention mechanism. For the decoder, the prediction of current utterance is also conditioned on the historic linguistic information through a conditional decoder framework. We show the effectiveness of our proposed method on several open-source dialogue corpora and the proposed method consistently improved the performance from the utterance-level Transformer-based ASR models.

 - **Abstract**
 End-to-end speech-to-text translation models are often initialized with pre-trained speech encoder and pre-trained text decoder. This leads to a significant training gap between pre-training and fine-tuning, largely due to the modality differences between speech outputs from the encoder and text inputs to the decoder. In this work, we aim to bridge the modality gap between speech and text to improve translation quality. We propose M-Adapter, a novel Transformer-based module, to adapt speech representations to text. While shrinking the speech sequence, M-Adapter produces features desired for speech-to-text translation via modelling global and local dependencies of a speech sequence. Our experimental results show that our model outperforms a strong baseline by up to 1 BLEU score on the Must-C En$\rightarrow$DE dataset.\footnote{Our code is available at https://github.com/mingzi151/w2v2-st.}

 - **Abstract**
 Procedural material graphs are a compact, parameteric, and resolution-independent representation that are a popular choice for material authoring. However, designing procedural materials requires significant expertise and publicly accessible libraries contain only a few thousand such graphs. We present MatFormer, a generative model that can produce a diverse set of high-quality procedural materials with complex spatial patterns and appearance. While procedural materials can be modeled as directed (operation) graphs, they contain arbitrary numbers of heterogeneous nodes with unstructured, often long-range node connections, and functional constraints on node parameters and connections. MatFormer addresses these challenges with a multi-stage transformer-based model that sequentially generates nodes, node parameters, and edges, while ensuring the semantic validity of the graph. In addition to generation, MatFormer can be used for the auto-completion and exploration of partial material graphs. We qualitatively and quantitatively demonstrate that our method outperforms alternative approaches, in both generated graph and material quality.

 - **Abstract**
 Most systems use different models for different modalities, such as one model for processing RGB images and one for depth images. Meanwhile, some recent works discovered that an identical model for one modality can be used for another modality with the help of cross modality transfer learning. In this article, we further find out that by using a vision transformer together with cross/inter modality transfer learning, a unified detector can achieve better performances when using different modalities as inputs. The unified model is useful as we don't need to maintain separate models or weights for robotics, hence, it is more efficient. One application scenario of our unified system for robotics can be: without any model architecture and model weights updating, robotics can switch smoothly on using RGB camera or both RGB and Depth Sensor during the day time and Depth sensor during the night time . Experiments on SUN RGB-D dataset show: Our unified model is not only efficient, but also has a similar or better performance in terms of mAP50 based on SUNRGBD16 category: compare with the RGB only one, ours is slightly worse (52.3 $\to$ 51.9). compare with the point cloud only one, we have similar performance (52.7 $\to$ 52.8); When using the novel inter modality mixing method proposed in this work, our model can achieve a significantly better performance with 3.1 (52.7 $\to$ 55.8) absolute improvement comparing with the previous best result.

 - **Abstract**
 Relying on Transformer for complex visual feature learning, object tracking has witnessed the new standard for state-of-the-arts (SOTAs). However, this advancement accompanies by larger training data and longer training period, making tracking increasingly expensive. In this paper, we demonstrate that the Transformer-reliance is not necessary and the pure ConvNets are still competitive and even better yet more economical and friendly in achieving SOTA tracking. Our solution is to unleash the power of multimodal vision-language (VL) tracking, simply using ConvNets. The essence lies in learning novel unified-adaptive VL representations with our modality mixer (ModaMixer) and asymmetrical ConvNet search. We show that our unified-adaptive VL representation, learned purely with the ConvNets, is a simple yet strong alternative to Transformer visual features, by unbelievably improving a CNN-based Siamese tracker by 14.5% in SUC on challenging LaSOT (50.7% > 65.2%), even outperforming several Transformer-based SOTA trackers. Besides empirical results, we theoretically analyze our approach to evidence its effectiveness. By revealing the potential of VL representation, we expect the community to divert more attention to VL tracking and hope to open more possibilities for future tracking beyond Transformer.

 - **Abstract**
 Existing RGB-D SOD methods mainly rely on a symmetric two-stream CNN-based network to extract RGB and depth channel features separately. However, there are two problems with the symmetric conventional network structure: first, the ability of CNN in learning global contexts is limited; second, the symmetric two-stream structure ignores the inherent differences between modalities. In this paper, we propose a Transformer-based asymmetric network (TANet) to tackle the issues mentioned above. We employ the powerful feature extraction capability of Transformer (PVTv2) to extract global semantic information from RGB data and design a lightweight CNN backbone (LWDepthNet) to extract spatial structure information from depth data without pre-training. The asymmetric hybrid encoder (AHE) effectively reduces the number of parameters in the model while increasing speed without sacrificing performance. Then, we design a cross-modal feature fusion module (CMFFM), which enhances and fuses RGB and depth features with each other. Finally, we add edge prediction as an auxiliary task and propose an edge enhancement module (EEM) to generate sharper contours. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance over 14 state-of-the-art RGB-D methods on six public datasets. Our code will be released at https://github.com/lc012463/TANet.

 - **Abstract**
 Multivariate time series forecasting has seen widely ranging applications in various domains, including finance, traffic, energy, and healthcare. To capture the sophisticated temporal patterns, plenty of research studies designed complex neural network architectures based on many variants of RNNs, GNNs, and Transformers. However, complex models are often computationally expensive and thus face a severe challenge in training and inference efficiency when applied to large-scale real-world datasets. In this paper, we introduce LightTS, a light deep learning architecture merely based on simple MLP-based structures. The key idea of LightTS is to apply an MLP-based structure on top of two delicate down-sampling strategies, including interval sampling and continuous sampling, inspired by a crucial fact that down-sampling time series often preserves the majority of its information. We conduct extensive experiments on eight widely used benchmark datasets. Compared with the existing state-of-the-art methods, LightTS demonstrates better performance on five of them and comparable performance on the rest. Moreover, LightTS is highly efficient. It uses less than 5% FLOPS compared with previous SOTA methods on the largest benchmark dataset. In addition, LightTS is robust and has a much smaller variance in forecasting accuracy than previous SOTA methods in long sequence forecasting tasks.

 - **Abstract**
 We carry out a comprehensive evaluation of 13 recent models for ranking of long documents using two popular collections (MS MARCO documents and Robust04). Our model zoo includes two specialized Transformer models (such as Longformer) that can process long documents without the need to split them. Along the way, we document several difficulties regarding training and comparing such models. Somewhat surprisingly, we find the simple FirstP baseline (truncating documents to satisfy the input-sequence constraint of a typical Transformer model) to be quite effective. We analyze the distribution of relevant passages (inside documents) to explain this phenomenon. We further argue that, despite their widespread use, Robust04 and MS MARCO documents are not particularly useful for benchmarking of long-document models.

 - **Abstract**
 Customized keyword spotting (KWS) has great potential to be deployed on edge devices to achieve hands-free user experience. However, in real applications, false alarm (FA) would be a serious problem for spotting dozens or even hundreds of keywords, which drastically affects user experience. To solve this problem, in this paper, we leverage the recent advances in transducer and transformer based acoustic models and propose a new multi-stage customized KWS framework named Cascaded Transducer-Transformer KWS (CaTT-KWS), which includes a transducer based keyword detector, a frame-level phone predictor based force alignment module and a transformer based decoder. Specifically, the streaming transducer module is used to spot keyword candidates in audio stream. Then force alignment is implemented using the phone posteriors predicted by the phone predictor to finish the first stage keyword verification and refine the time boundaries of keyword. Finally, the transformer decoder further verifies the triggered keyword. Our proposed CaTT-KWS framework reduces FA rate effectively without obviously hurting keyword recognition accuracy. Specifically, we can get impressively 0.13 FA per hour on a challenging dataset, with over 90% relative reduction on FA comparing to the transducer based detection model, while keyword recognition accuracy only drops less than 2%.

 - **Abstract**
 Zero-shot learning (ZSL) aims to predict unseen classes whose samples have never appeared during training, often utilizing additional semantic information (a.k.a. side information) to bridge the training (seen) classes and the unseen classes. One of the most effective and widely used semantic information for zero-shot image classification are attributes which are annotations for class-level visual characteristics. However, due to the shortage of fine-grained annotations, the attribute imbalance and co-occurrence, the current methods often fail to discriminate those subtle visual distinctions between images, which limits their performances. In this paper, we present a transformer-based end-to-end ZSL method named DUET, which integrates latent semantic knowledge from the pretrained language models (PLMs) via a self-supervised multi-modal learning paradigm. Specifically, we (1) developed a cross-modal semantic grounding network to investigate the model's capability of disentangling semantic attributes from the images, (2) applied an attribute-level contrastive learning strategy to further enhance the model's discrimination on fine-grained visual characteristics against the attribute co-occurrence and imbalance, and (3) proposed a multi-task learning policy for considering multi-model objectives. With extensive experiments on three standard ZSL benchmarks and a knowledge graph equipped ZSL benchmark, we find that DUET can often achieve state-of-the-art performance, its components are effective and its predictions are interpretable.

 - **Abstract**
 Generally pre-training and long-time training computation are necessary for obtaining a good-performance text detector based on deep networks. In this paper, we present a new scene text detection network (called FANet) with a Fast convergence speed and Accurate text localization. The proposed FANet is an end-to-end text detector based on transformer feature learning and normalized Fourier descriptor modeling, where the Fourier Descriptor Proposal Network and Iterative Text Decoding Network are designed to efficiently and accurately identify text proposals. Additionally, a Dense Matching Strategy and a well-designed loss function are also proposed for optimizing the network performance. Extensive experiments are carried out to demonstrate that the proposed FANet can achieve the SOTA performance with fewer training epochs and no pre-training. When we introduce additional data for pre-training, the proposed FANet can achieve SOTA performance on MSRATD500, CTW1500 and TotalText. The ablation experiments also verify the effectiveness of our contributions.

 - **Abstract**
 We have seen a great progress in video action recognition in recent years. There are several models based on convolutional neural network (CNN) with some recent transformer based approaches which provide state-of-the-art performance on existing benchmark datasets. However, large-scale robustness has not been studied for these models which is a critical aspect for real-world applications. In this work we perform a large-scale robustness analysis of these existing models for video action recognition. We mainly focus on robustness against distribution shifts due to real-world perturbations instead of adversarial perturbations. We propose four different benchmark datasets, HMDB-51P, UCF-101P, Kinetics-400P, and SSv2P and study the robustness of six different state-of-the-art action recognition models against 90 different perturbations. The study reveals some interesting findings, 1) transformer based models are consistently more robust against most of the perturbations when compared with CNN based models, 2) Pretraining helps Transformer based models to be more robust to different perturbations than CNN based models, and 3) All of the studied models are robust to temporal perturbation on the Kinetics dataset, but not on SSv2; this suggests temporal information is much more important for action label prediction on SSv2 datasets than on the Kinetics dataset. We hope that this study will serve as a benchmark for future research in robust video action recognition. More details about the project are available at https://rose-ar.github.io/.
### I-ViT: Integer-only Quantization for Efficient Vision Transformer  Inference

 - **Abstract**
 Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance on various computer vision applications. These models, however, have considerable storage and computational overheads, making their deployment and efficient inference on edge devices challenging. Quantization is a promising approach to reducing model complexity; unfortunately, existing efforts to quantize ViTs are simulated quantization (aka fake quantization), which remains floating-point arithmetic during inference and thus contributes little to model acceleration. In this paper, we propose I-ViT, an integer-only quantization scheme for ViTs, to enable ViTs to perform the entire computational graph of inference with integer operations and bit-shifting and no floating-point operations. In I-ViT, linear operations (e.g., MatMul and Dense) follow the integer-only pipeline with dyadic arithmetic, and non-linear operations (e.g., Softmax, GELU, and LayerNorm) are approximated by the proposed light-weight integer-only arithmetic methods. In particular, I-ViT applies the proposed Shiftmax and ShiftGELU, which are designed to use integer bit-shifting to approximate the corresponding floating-point operations. We evaluate I-ViT on various benchmark models and the results show that integer-only INT8 quantization achieves comparable (or even higher) accuracy to the full-precision (FP) baseline. Furthermore, we utilize TVM for practical hardware deployment on the GPU's integer arithmetic units, achieving 3.72~4.11$\times$ inference speedup compared to the FP model.

 - **Abstract**
 The contextual information is critical for various computer vision tasks, previous works commonly design plug-and-play modules and structural losses to effectively extract and aggregate the global context. These methods utilize fine-label to optimize the model but ignore that fine-trained features are also precious training resources, which can introduce preferable distribution to hard pixels (i.e., misclassified pixels). Inspired by contrastive learning in unsupervised paradigm, we apply the contrastive loss in a supervised manner and re-design the loss function to cast off the stereotype of unsupervised learning (e.g., imbalance of positives and negatives, confusion of anchors computing). To this end, we propose Positive-Negative Equal contrastive loss (PNE loss), which increases the latent impact of positive embedding on the anchor and treats the positive as well as negative sample pairs equally. The PNE loss can be directly plugged right into existing semantic segmentation frameworks and leads to excellent performance with neglectable extra computational costs. We utilize a number of classic segmentation methods (e.g., DeepLabV3, OCRNet, UperNet) and backbone (e.g., ResNet, HRNet, Swin Transformer) to conduct comprehensive experiments and achieve state-of-the-art performance on two benchmark datasets (e.g., Cityscapes and COCO-Stuff).

 With the development of computer technology, various models have emerged in artificial intelligence. The transformer model has been applied to the field of computer vision (CV) after its success in natural language processing (NLP). Radiologists continue to face multiple challenges in today's rapidly evolving medical field, such as increased workload and increased diagnostic demands. Although there are some conventional methods for lung cancer detection before, their accuracy still needs to be improved, especially in realistic diagnostic scenarios. This paper creatively proposes a segmentation method based on efficient transformer and applies it to medical image analysis. The algorithm completes the task of lung cancer classification and segmentation by analyzing lung cancer data, and aims to provide efficient technical support for medical staff. In addition, we evaluated and compared the results in various aspects. For the classification mission, the max accuracy of Swin-T by regular training and Swin-B in two resolutions by pre-training can be up to 82.3%. For the segmentation mission, we use pre-training to help the model improve the accuracy of our experiments. The accuracy of the three models reaches over 95%. The experiments demonstrate that the algorithm can be well applied to lung cancer classification and segmentation missions.

 - **Abstract**
 Transformer-based Self-supervised Representation Learning methods learn generic features from unlabeled datasets for providing useful network initialization parameters for downstream tasks. Recently, self-supervised learning based upon masking local surface patches for 3D point cloud data has been under-explored. In this paper, we propose masked Autoencoders in 3D point cloud representation learning (abbreviated as MAE3D), a novel autoencoding paradigm for self-supervised learning. We first split the input point cloud into patches and mask a portion of them, then use our Patch Embedding Module to extract the features of unmasked patches. Secondly, we employ patch-wise MAE3D Transformers to learn both local features of point cloud patches and high-level contextual relationships between patches and complete the latent representations of masked patches. We use our Point Cloud Reconstruction Module with multi-task loss to complete the incomplete point cloud as a result. We conduct self-supervised pre-training on ShapeNet55 with the point cloud completion pre-text task and fine-tune the pre-trained model on ModelNet40 and ScanObjectNN (PB\_T50\_RS, the hardest variant). Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the local features extracted by our MAE3D from point cloud patches are beneficial for downstream classification tasks, soundly outperforming state-of-the-art methods ($93.4\%$ and $86.2\%$ classification accuracy, respectively).

 - **Abstract**
 This paper tackles the problem of human motion prediction, consisting in forecasting future body poses from historically observed sequences. Despite of their performance, current state-of-the-art approaches rely on deep learning architectures of arbitrary complexity, such as Recurrent Neural Networks~(RNN), Transformers or Graph Convolutional Networks~(GCN), typically requiring multiple training stages and more than 3 million of parameters. In this paper we show that the performance of these approaches can be surpassed by a light-weight and purely MLP architecture with only 0.14M parameters when appropriately combined with several standard practices such as representing the body pose with Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), predicting residual displacement of joints and optimizing velocity as an auxiliary loss. An exhaustive evaluation on Human3.6M, AMASS and 3DPW datasets shows that our method, which we dub siMLPe, consistently outperforms all other approaches. We hope that our simple method could serve a strong baseline to the community and allow re-thinking the problem of human motion prediction and whether current benchmarks do really need intricate architectural designs.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we present a new approach for model acceleration by exploiting spatial sparsity in visual data. We observe that the final prediction in vision Transformers is only based on a subset of the most informative tokens, which is sufficient for accurate image recognition. Based on this observation, we propose a dynamic token sparsification framework to prune redundant tokens progressively and dynamically based on the input to accelerate vision Transformers. Specifically, we devise a lightweight prediction module to estimate the importance score of each token given the current features. The module is added to different layers to prune redundant tokens hierarchically. While the framework is inspired by our observation of the sparse attention in vision Transformers, we find the idea of adaptive and asymmetric computation can be a general solution for accelerating various architectures. We extend our method to hierarchical models including CNNs and hierarchical vision Transformers as well as more complex dense prediction tasks that require structured feature maps by formulating a more generic dynamic spatial sparsification framework with progressive sparsification and asymmetric computation for different spatial locations. By applying lightweight fast paths to less informative features and using more expressive slow paths to more important locations, we can maintain the structure of feature maps while significantly reducing the overall computations. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on various modern architectures and different visual recognition tasks. Our results clearly demonstrate that dynamic spatial sparsification offers a new and more effective dimension for model acceleration. Code is available at https://github.com/raoyongming/DynamicViT

 - **Abstract**
 Aiming to restore the original intensity of shadow regions in an image and make them compatible with the remaining non-shadow regions without a trace, shadow removal is a very challenging problem that benefits many downstream image/video-related tasks. Recently, transformers have shown their strong capability in various applications by capturing global pixel interactions and this capability is highly desirable in shadow removal. However, applying transformers to promote shadow removal is non-trivial for the following two reasons: 1) The patchify operation is not suitable for shadow removal due to irregular shadow shapes; 2) shadow removal only needs one-way interaction from the non-shadow region to the shadow region instead of the common two-way interactions among all pixels in the image. In this paper, we propose a novel cross-region transformer, namely CRFormer, for shadow removal which differs from existing transformers by only considering the pixel interactions from the non-shadow region to the shadow region without splitting images into patches. This is achieved by a carefully designed region-aware cross-attention operation that can aggregate the recovered shadow region features conditioned on the non-shadow region features. Extensive experiments on ISTD, AISTD, SRD, and Video Shadow Removal datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method compared to other state-of-the-art methods.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper is the first to provide a thorough system design overview along with the fusion methods selection criteria of a real-world cooperative autonomous driving system, named Infrastructure-Augmented Autonomous Driving or IAAD. We present an in-depth introduction of the IAAD hardware and software on both road-side and vehicle-side computing and communication platforms. We extensively characterize the IAAD system in the context of real-world deployment scenarios and observe that the network condition that fluctuates along the road is currently the main technical roadblock for cooperative autonomous driving. To address this challenge, we propose new fusion methods, dubbed "inter-frame fusion" and "planning fusion" to complement the current state-of-the-art "intra-frame fusion". We demonstrate that each fusion method has its own benefit and constraint.

 - **Abstract**
 A typical trajectory planner of autonomous driving usually relies on predicting the future behavior of surrounding obstacles. In recent years, prediction models based on deep learning have been widely used due to their impressive performance. However, recent studies have shown that deep learning models trained on a dataset following a long-tailed driving scenario distribution will suffer from large prediction errors in the "tails," which might lead to failures of the planner. To this end, this work defines a notion of prediction model uncertainty to quantify high errors due to sparse data. Moreover, this work proposes a trajectory planner to consider such prediction uncertainty for safer performance. Firstly, the prediction model's uncertainty due to insufficient training data is estimated by an ensemble network structure. Then a trajectory planner is designed to consider the worst-case arising from prediction uncertainty. The results show that the proposed method can improve the safety of trajectory planning under the prediction uncertainty caused by insufficient data. At the same time, with sufficient data, the framework will not lead to overly conservative results. This technology helps to improve the safety and reliability of autonomous vehicles under the long-tail data distribution of the real world.

 Despite significant academic and corporate efforts, autonomous driving under adverse visual conditions still proves challenging. As neuromorphic technology has matured, its application to robotics and autonomous vehicle systems has become an area of active research. Low-light and latency-demanding situations can benefit. To enable event cameras to operate alongside staple sensors like lidar in perception tasks, we propose a direct, temporally-decoupled calibration method between event cameras and lidars. The high dynamic range and low-light operation of event cameras are exploited to directly register lidar laser returns, allowing information-based correlation methods to optimize for the 6-DoF extrinsic calibration between the two sensors. This paper presents the first direct calibration method between event cameras and lidars, removing dependencies on frame-based camera intermediaries and/or highly-accurate hand measurements. Code will be made publicly available.

 Semantic segmentation on driving-scene images is vital for autonomous driving. Although encouraging performance has been achieved on daytime images, the performance on nighttime images are less satisfactory due to the insufficient exposure and the lack of labeled data. To address these issues, we present an add-on module called dual image-adaptive learnable filters (DIAL-Filters) to improve the semantic segmentation in nighttime driving conditions, aiming at exploiting the intrinsic features of driving-scene images under different illuminations. DIAL-Filters consist of two parts, including an image-adaptive processing module (IAPM) and a learnable guided filter (LGF). With DIAL-Filters, we design both unsupervised and supervised frameworks for nighttime driving-scene segmentation, which can be trained in an end-to-end manner. Specifically, the IAPM module consists of a small convolutional neural network with a set of differentiable image filters, where each image can be adaptively enhanced for better segmentation with respect to the different illuminations. The LGF is employed to enhance the output of segmentation network to get the final segmentation result. The DIAL-Filters are light-weight and efficient and they can be readily applied for both daytime and nighttime images. Our experiments show that DAIL-Filters can significantly improve the supervised segmentation performance on ACDC_Night and NightCity datasets, while it demonstrates the state-of-the-art performance on unsupervised nighttime semantic segmentation on Dark Zurich and Nighttime Driving testbeds.

 - **Abstract**
 Current methods for LIDAR semantic segmentation are not robust enough for real-world applications, e.g., autonomous driving, since it is closed-set and static. The closed-set assumption makes the network only able to output labels of trained classes, even for objects never seen before, while a static network cannot update its knowledge base according to what it has seen. Therefore, in this work, we propose the open-world semantic segmentation task for LIDAR point clouds, which aims to 1) identify both old and novel classes using open-set semantic segmentation, and 2) gradually incorporate novel objects into the existing knowledge base using incremental learning without forgetting old classes. For this purpose, we propose a REdundAncy cLassifier (REAL) framework to provide a general architecture for both the open-set semantic segmentation and incremental learning problems. The experimental results show that REAL can simultaneously achieves state-of-the-art performance in the open-set semantic segmentation task on the SemanticKITTI and nuScenes datasets, and alleviate the catastrophic forgetting problem with a large margin during incremental learning.
