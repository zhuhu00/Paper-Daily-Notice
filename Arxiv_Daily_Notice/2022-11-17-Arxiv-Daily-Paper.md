 - **Abstract**
 Self-supervised learning of egomotion and depth has recently attracted great attentions. These learning models can provide pose and depth maps to support navigation and perception task for autonomous driving and robots, while they do not require high-precision ground-truth labels to train the networks. However, monocular vision based methods suffer from pose scale-ambiguity problem, so that can not generate physical meaningful trajectory, and thus their applications are limited in real-world. We propose a novel self-learning deep neural network framework that can learn to estimate egomotion and depths with absolute metric scale from monocular images. Coarse depth scale is recovered via comparing point cloud data against a pretrained model that ensures the consistency of photometric loss. The scale-ambiguity problem is solved by introducing a novel two-stages coarse-to-fine scale recovery strategy that jointly refines coarse poses and depths. Our model successfully produces pose and depth estimates in global scale-metric, even in low-light condition, i.e. driving at night. The evaluation on the public datasets demonstrates that our model outperforms both representative traditional and learning based VOs and VIOs, e.g. VINS-mono, ORB-SLAM, SC-Learner, and UnVIO.

 - **Abstract**
 Contemporary autonomous vehicle (AV) benchmarks have advanced techniques for training 3D detectors, particularly on large-scale lidar data. Surprisingly, although semantic class labels naturally follow a long-tailed distribution, contemporary benchmarks focus on only a few common classes (e.g., pedestrian and car) and neglect many rare classes in-the-tail (e.g., debris and stroller). However, AVs must still detect rare classes to ensure safe operation. Moreover, semantic classes are often organized within a hierarchy, e.g., tail classes such as child and construction-worker are arguably subclasses of pedestrian. However, such hierarchical relationships are often ignored, which may lead to misleading estimates of performance and missed opportunities for algorithmic innovation. We address these challenges by formally studying the problem of Long-Tailed 3D Detection (LT3D), which evaluates on all classes, including those in-the-tail. We evaluate and innovate upon popular 3D detection codebases, such as CenterPoint and PointPillars, adapting them for LT3D. We develop hierarchical losses that promote feature sharing across common-vs-rare classes, as well as improved detection metrics that award partial credit to "reasonable" mistakes respecting the hierarchy (e.g., mistaking a child for an adult). Finally, we point out that fine-grained tail class accuracy is particularly improved via multimodal fusion of RGB images with LiDAR; simply put, small fine-grained classes are challenging to identify from sparse (lidar) geometry alone, suggesting that multimodal cues are crucial to long-tailed 3D detection. Our modifications improve accuracy by 5% AP on average for all classes, and dramatically improve AP for rare classes (e.g., stroller AP improves from 3.6 to 31.6)!

### CoNFies: Controllable Neural Face Avatars

 - **Abstract**
 Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) are compelling techniques for modeling dynamic 3D scenes from 2D image collections. These volumetric representations would be well suited for synthesizing novel facial expressions but for two problems. First, deformable NeRFs are object agnostic and model holistic movement of the scene: they can replay how the motion changes over time, but they cannot alter it in an interpretable way. Second, controllable volumetric representations typically require either time-consuming manual annotations or 3D supervision to provide semantic meaning to the scene. We propose a controllable neural representation for face self-portraits (CoNFies), that solves both of these problems within a common framework, and it can rely on automated processing. We use automated facial action recognition (AFAR) to characterize facial expressions as a combination of action units (AU) and their intensities. AUs provide both the semantic locations and control labels for the system. CoNFies outperformed competing methods for novel view and expression synthesis in terms of visual and anatomic fidelity of expressions.

### Structured Exploration Through Instruction Enhancement for Object  Navigation

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.08467
 - **Abstract**
 Finding an object of a specific class in an unseen environment remains an unsolved navigation problem. Hence, we propose a hierarchical learning-based method for object navigation. The top-level is capable of high-level planning, and building a memory on a floorplan-level (e.g., which room makes the most sense for the agent to visit next, where has the agent already been?). While the lower-level is tasked with efficiently navigating between rooms and looking for objects in them. Instructions can be provided to the agent using a simple synthetic language. The top-level intelligently enhances the instructions in order to make the overall task more tractable. Language grounding, mapping instructions to visual observations, is performed by utilizing an additional separate supervised trained goal assessment module. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on a dynamic configurable domestic environment.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.08624
 - **Abstract**
 Most speech enhancement (SE) models learn a point estimate, and do not make use of uncertainty estimation in the learning process. In this paper, we show that modeling heteroscedastic uncertainty by minimizing a multivariate Gaussian negative log-likelihood (NLL) improves SE performance at no extra cost. During training, our approach augments a model learning complex spectral mapping with a temporary submodel to predict the covariance of the enhancement error at each time-frequency bin. Due to unrestricted heteroscedastic uncertainty, the covariance introduces an undersampling effect, detrimental to SE performance. To mitigate undersampling, our approach inflates the uncertainty lower bound and weights each loss component with their uncertainty, effectively compensating severely undersampled components with more penalties. Our multivariate setting reveals common covariance assumptions such as scalar and diagonal matrices. By weakening these assumptions, we show that the NLL achieves superior performance compared to popular losses including the mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and scale-invariant signal-to-distortion ratio (SI-SDR).

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we propose a new method for mapping a 3D point cloud to the latent space of a 3D generative adversarial network. Our generative model for 3D point clouds is based on SP-GAN, a state-of-the-art sphere-guided 3D point cloud generator. We derive an efficient way to encode an input 3D point cloud to the latent space of the SP-GAN. Our point cloud encoder can resolve the point ordering issue during inversion, and thus can determine the correspondences between points in the generated 3D point cloud and those in the canonical sphere used by the generator. We show that our method outperforms previous GAN inversion methods for 3D point clouds, achieving state-of-the-art results both quantitatively and qualitatively. Our code is available at https://github.com/hkust-vgd/point_inverter.

 - **Abstract**
 This first-of-its-kind paper presents a novel approach named PASAD that detects changes in perceptually fluent speech acoustics of young children. Particularly, analysis of perceptually fluent speech enables identifying the speech-motor-control factors that are considered as the underlying cause of stuttering disfluencies. Recent studies indicate that the speech production of young children, especially those who stutter, may get adversely affected by situational physiological arousal. A major contribution of this paper is leveraging the speaker's situational physiological responses in real-time to analyze the speech signal effectively. The presented PASAD approach adapts a Hyper-Network structure to extract temporal speech importance information leveraging physiological parameters. In addition, a novel non-local acoustic spectrogram feature extraction network identifies meaningful acoustic attributes. Finally, a sequential network utilizes the acoustic attributes and the extracted temporal speech importance for effective classification. We collected speech and physiological sensing data from 73 preschool-age children who stutter (CWS) and who don't stutter (CWNS) in different conditions. PASAD's unique architecture enables visualizing speech attributes distinct to a CWS's fluent speech and mapping them to the speaker's respective speech-motor-control factors (i.e., speech articulators). Extracted knowledge can enhance understanding of children's fluent speech, speech-motor-control (SMC), and stuttering development. Our comprehensive evaluation shows that PASAD outperforms state-of-the-art multi-modal baseline approaches in different conditions, is expressive and adaptive to the speaker's speech and physiology, generalizable, robust, and is real-time executable on mobile and scalable devices.

### LiePoseNet: Heterogeneous Loss Function Based on Lie Group for  Significant Speed-up of PoseNet Training Process

 - **Abstract**
 Visual localization is an essential modern technology for robotics and computer vision. Popular approaches for solving this task are image-based methods. Nowadays, these methods have low accuracy and a long training time. The reasons are the lack of rigid-body and projective geometry awareness, landmark symmetry, and homogeneous error assumption. We propose a heterogeneous loss function based on concentrated Gaussian distribution with the Lie group to overcome these difficulties. Following our experiment, the proposed method allows us to speed up the training process significantly (from 300 to 10 epochs) with acceptable error values.
### CXTrack: Improving 3D Point Cloud Tracking with Contextual Information

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.08542
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.08542
 - **Abstract**
 3D single object tracking plays an essential role in many applications, such as autonomous driving. It remains a challenging problem due to the large appearance variation and the sparsity of points caused by occlusion and limited sensor capabilities. Therefore, contextual information across two consecutive frames is crucial for effective object tracking. However, points containing such useful information are often overlooked and cropped out in existing methods, leading to insufficient use of important contextual knowledge. To address this issue, we propose CXTrack, a novel transformer-based network for 3D object tracking, which exploits ConteXtual information to improve the tracking results. Specifically, we design a target-centric transformer network that directly takes point features from two consecutive frames and the previous bounding box as input to explore contextual information and implicitly propagate target cues. To achieve accurate localization for objects of all sizes, we propose a transformer-based localization head with a novel center embedding module to distinguish the target from distractors. Extensive experiments on three large-scale datasets, KITTI, nuScenes and Waymo Open Dataset, show that CXTrack achieves state-of-the-art tracking performance while running at 29 FPS.

 - **Abstract**
 Feature matching is an essential step in visual localization, where the accuracy of camera pose is mainly determined by the established 2D-3D correspondence. Due to the noise, solving the camera pose accurately requires a sufficient number of well-distributed 2D-3D correspondences. Existing 2D-3D feature matching is typically achieved by finding the nearest neighbors in the feature space, and then removing the outliers by some hand-crafted heuristics. However, this may lead to a large number of potentially true matches being missed or the established correct matches being filtered out. In this work, we introduce a novel 2D-3D matching method, Geometry-Aided Matching (GAM), which uses both appearance information and geometric context to improve 2D-3D feature matching. GAM can greatly strengthen the recall of 2D-3D matches while maintaining high precision. We insert GAM into a hierarchical visual localization pipeline and show that GAM can effectively improve the robustness and accuracy of localization. Extensive experiments show that GAM can find more correct matches than hand-crafted heuristics and learning baselines. Our proposed localization method achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple visual localization datasets. Experiments on Cambridge Landmarks dataset show that our method outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods and is six times faster than the top-performed method.

 - **Abstract**
 With the emerge of the Internet of Things (IoT), localization within indoor environments has become inevitable and has attracted a great deal of attention in recent years. Several efforts have been made to cope with the challenges of accurate positioning systems in the presence of signal interference. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning approach through Gradient Boosting Enhanced with Step-Wise Feature Augmentation using Artificial Neural Network (AugBoost-ANN) for indoor localization applications as it trains over labeled data. For this purpose, we propose an IoT architecture using a star network topology to collect the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) modules by means of a Raspberry Pi as an Access Point (AP) in an indoor environment. The dataset for the experiments is gathered in the real world in different periods to match the real environments. Next, we address the challenges of the AugBoost-ANN training which augments features in each iteration of making a decision tree using a deep neural network and the transfer learning technique. Experimental results show more than 8\% improvement in terms of accuracy in comparison with the existing gradient boosting and deep learning methods recently proposed in the literature, and our proposed model acquires a mean location accuracy of 0.77 m.
### Region Proposal Network Pre-Training Helps Label-Efficient Object  Detection

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.09022
 - **Abstract**
 Self-supervised pre-training, based on the pretext task of instance discrimination, has fueled the recent advance in label-efficient object detection. However, existing studies focus on pre-training only a feature extractor network to learn transferable representations for downstream detection tasks. This leads to the necessity of training multiple detection-specific modules from scratch in the fine-tuning phase. We argue that the region proposal network (RPN), a common detection-specific module, can additionally be pre-trained towards reducing the localization error of multi-stage detectors. In this work, we propose a simple pretext task that provides an effective pre-training for the RPN, towards efficiently improving downstream object detection performance. We evaluate the efficacy of our approach on benchmark object detection tasks and additional downstream tasks, including instance segmentation and few-shot detection. In comparison with multi-stage detectors without RPN pre-training, our approach is able to consistently improve downstream task performance, with largest gains found in label-scarce settings.

### Latent Bottlenecked Attentive Neural Processes

 - **Abstract**
 Neural Processes (NPs) are popular methods in meta-learning that can estimate predictive uncertainty on target datapoints by conditioning on a context dataset. Previous state-of-the-art method Transformer Neural Processes (TNPs) achieve strong performance but require quadratic computation with respect to the number of context datapoints, significantly limiting its scalability. Conversely, existing sub-quadratic NP variants perform significantly worse than that of TNPs. Tackling this issue, we propose Latent Bottlenecked Attentive Neural Processes (LBANPs), a new computationally efficient sub-quadratic NP variant, that has a querying computational complexity independent of the number of context datapoints. The model encodes the context dataset into a constant number of latent vectors on which self-attention is performed. When making predictions, the model retrieves higher-order information from the context dataset via multiple cross-attention mechanisms on the latent vectors. We empirically show that LBANPs achieve results competitive with the state-of-the-art on meta-regression, image completion, and contextual multi-armed bandits. We demonstrate that LBANPs can trade-off the computational cost and performance according to the number of latent vectors. Finally, we show LBANPs can scale beyond existing attention-based NP variants to larger dataset settings.

 Because traffic characteristics display stochastic nonlinear spatiotemporal dependencies, traffic prediction is a challenging task. In this paper develop a graph convolution gated recurrent unit (GC GRU N) network to extract the essential Spatio temporal features. we use Seattle loop detector data aggregated over 15 minutes and reframe the problem through space and time. The model performance is compared o benchmark models; Historical Average, Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), and Transformers. The proposed model ranked second with the fastest inference time and a very close performance to first place (Transformers). Our model also achieves a running time that is six times faster than transformers. Finally, we present a comparative study of our model and the available benchmarks using metrics such as training time, inference time, MAPE, MAE and RMSE. Spatial and temporal aspects are also analyzed for each of the trained models.

 - **Abstract**
 Self-attention mechanisms, especially multi-head self-attention (MSA), have achieved great success in many fields such as computer vision and natural language processing. However, many existing vision transformer (ViT) works simply inherent transformer designs from NLP to adapt vision tasks, while ignoring the fundamental difference between ``how MSA works in image and language settings''. Language naturally contains highly semantic structures that are directly interpretable by humans. Its basic unit (word) is discrete without redundant information, which readily supports interpretable studies on MSA mechanisms of language transformer. In contrast, visual data exhibits a fundamentally different structure: Its basic unit (pixel) is a natural low-level representation with significant redundancies in the neighbourhood, which poses obvious challenges to the interpretability of MSA mechanism in ViT. In this paper, we introduce a typical image processing technique, i.e., scale-invariant feature transforms (SIFTs), which maps low-level representations into mid-level spaces, and annotates extensive discrete keypoints with semantically rich information. Next, we construct a weighted patch interrelation analysis based on SIFT keypoints to capture the attention patterns hidden in patches with different semantic concentrations Interestingly, we find this quantitative analysis is not only an effective complement to the interpretability of MSA mechanisms in ViT, but can also be applied to 1) spurious correlation discovery and ``prompting'' during model inference, 2) and guided model pre-training acceleration. Experimental results on both applications show significant advantages over baselines, demonstrating the efficacy of our method.

 - **Abstract**
 Convolutional neural network (CNN) based methods have achieved great successes in medical image segmentation, but their capability to learn global representations is still limited due to using small effective receptive fields of convolution operations. Transformer based methods are capable of modelling long-range dependencies of information for capturing global representations, yet their ability to model local context is lacking. Integrating CNN and Transformer to learn both local and global representations while exploring multi-scale features is instrumental in further improving medical image segmentation. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical CNN and Transformer hybrid architecture, called ConvFormer, for medical image segmentation. ConvFormer is based on several simple yet effective designs. (1) A feed forward module of Deformable Transformer (DeTrans) is re-designed to introduce local information, called Enhanced DeTrans. (2) A residual-shaped hybrid stem based on a combination of convolutions and Enhanced DeTrans is developed to capture both local and global representations to enhance representation ability. (3) Our encoder utilizes the residual-shaped hybrid stem in a hierarchical manner to generate feature maps in different scales, and an additional Enhanced DeTrans encoder with residual connections is built to exploit multi-scale features with feature maps of different scales as input. Experiments on several datasets show that our ConvFormer, trained from scratch, outperforms various CNN- or Transformer-based architectures, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

 - **Abstract**
 Conventional fine-tuning encounters increasing difficulties given the size of current Pre-trained Language Models, which makes parameter-efficient tuning become the focal point of frontier research. Previous methods in this field add tunable adapters into MHA or/and FFN of Transformer blocks to enable PLMs achieve transferability. However, as an important part of Transformer architecture, the power of layer normalization for parameter-efficent tuning is ignored. In this paper, we first propose LN-tuning, by tuning the gain and bias term of Layer Normalization module with only 0.03\% parameters, which is of high time-efficency and significantly superior to baselines which are less than 0.1\% tunable parameters. Further, we study the unified framework of combining LN-tuning with previous ones and we find that: (1) the unified framework of combining prefix-tuning, the adapter-based method working on MHA, and LN-tuning achieves SOTA performance. (2) unified framework which tunes MHA and LayerNorm simultaneously can get performance improvement but those which tune FFN and LayerNorm simultaneous will cause performance decrease. Ablation study validates LN-tuning is of no abundant parameters and gives a further understanding of it.

 - **Abstract**
 Video Super-Resolution (VSR) aims to recover sequences of high-resolution (HR) frames from low-resolution (LR) frames. Previous methods mainly utilize temporally adjacent frames to assist the reconstruction of target frames. However, in the real world, there is a lot of irrelevant information in adjacent frames of videos with fast scene switching, these VSR methods cannot adaptively distinguish and select useful information. In contrast, with a transformer structure suitable for temporal tasks, we devise a novel adaptive scenario video super-resolution method. Specifically, we use optical flow to label the patches in each video frame, only calculate the attention of patches with the same label. Then select the most relevant label among them to supplement the spatial-temporal information of the target frame. This design can directly make the supplementary information come from the same scene as much as possible. We further propose a cross-scale feature aggregation module to better handle the scale variation problem. Compared with other video super-resolution methods, our method not only achieves significant performance gains on single-scene videos but also has better robustness on cross-scene datasets.

 - **Abstract**
 Disfluency detection has mainly been solved in a pipeline approach, as post-processing of speech recognition. In this study, we propose Transformer-based encoder-decoder models that jointly solve speech recognition and disfluency detection, which work in a streaming manner. Compared to pipeline approaches, the joint models can leverage acoustic information that makes disfluency detection robust to recognition errors and provide non-verbal clues. Moreover, joint modeling results in low-latency and lightweight inference. We investigate two joint model variants for streaming disfluency detection: a transcript-enriched model and a multi-task model. The transcript-enriched model is trained on text with special tags indicating the starting and ending points of the disfluent part. However, it has problems with latency and standard language model adaptation, which arise from the additional disfluency tags. We propose a multi-task model to solve such problems, which has two output layers at the Transformer decoder; one for speech recognition and the other for disfluency detection. It is modeled to be conditioned on the currently recognized token with an additional token-dependency mechanism. We show that the proposed joint models outperformed a BERT-based pipeline approach in both accuracy and latency, on both the Switchboard and the corpus of spontaneous Japanese.

 - **Abstract**
 Medical images are widely used in clinical practice for diagnosis. Automatically generating interpretable medical reports can reduce radiologists' burden and facilitate timely care. However, most existing approaches to automatic report generation require sufficient labeled data for training. In addition, the learned model can only generate reports for the training classes, lacking the ability to adapt to previously unseen novel diseases. To this end, we propose a lesion guided explainable few weak-shot medical report generation framework that learns correlation between seen and novel classes through visual and semantic feature alignment, aiming to generate medical reports for diseases not observed in training. It integrates a lesion-centric feature extractor and a Transformer-based report generation module. Concretely, the lesion-centric feature extractor detects the abnormal regions and learns correlations between seen and novel classes with multi-view (visual and lexical) embeddings. Then, features of the detected regions and corresponding embeddings are concatenated as multi-view input to the report generation module for explainable report generation, including text descriptions and corresponding abnormal regions detected in the images. We conduct experiments on FFA-IR, a dataset providing explainable annotations, showing that our framework outperforms others on report generation for novel diseases.

 - **Abstract**
 Multi-illuminant color constancy is a challenging problem with only a few existing methods. For example, one prior work used a small set of predefined white balance settings and spatially blended among them, limiting the solution to predefined illuminations. Another method proposed a generative adversarial network and an angular loss, yet the performance is suboptimal due to the lack of regularization for multi-illumination colors. This paper introduces a transformer-based multi-task learning method to estimate single and multiple light colors from a single input image. To help our deep learning model have better cues of the light colors, achromatic-pixel detection, and edge detection are used as auxiliary tasks in our multi-task learning setting. By exploiting extracted content features from the input image as tokens, illuminant color correlations between pixels are learned by leveraging contextual information in our transformer. Our transformer approach is further assisted via a contrastive loss defined between the input, output, and ground truth. We demonstrate that our proposed model achieves 40.7% improvement compared to a state-of-the-art multi-illuminant color constancy method on a multi-illuminant dataset (LSMI). Moreover, our model maintains a robust performance on the single illuminant dataset (NUS-8) and provides 22.3% improvement on the state-of-the-art single color constancy method.

 - **Abstract**
 We analyze the impact of speaker adaptation in end-to-end architectures based on transformers and wav2vec 2.0 under different noise conditions. We demonstrate that the proven method of concatenating speaker vectors to the acoustic features and supplying them as an auxiliary model input remains a viable option to increase the robustness of end-to-end architectures. By including speaker embeddings obtained from x-vector and ECAPA-TDNN models, we achieve relative word error rate improvements of up to 9.6% on LibriSpeech and up to 14.5% on Switchboard. The effect on transformer-based architectures is approximately inversely proportional to the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and is strongest in heavily noised environments ($SNR=0$). The most substantial benefit of speaker adaption in systems based on wav2vec 2.0 can be achieved under moderate noise conditions ($SNR\geq18$). We also find that x-vectors tend to yield larger improvements than ECAPA-TDNN embeddings.

 - **Abstract**
 As an application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, financial sentiment analysis (FSA) has become an invaluable tool for investors. Its speed and accuracy can significantly impact the returns of trading strategies.With the development of deep learning and Transformer-based pre-trained models like BERT, the accuracy of FSA has been much improved, but these time-consuming big models will also slow down the computation. To boost the processing speed of the FSA system and ensure high precision, we first propose an efficient and lightweight BERT (ELBERT) along with a novel confidence-window-based (CWB) early exit mechanism. Based on ELBERT, an innovative method to accelerate text processing on the GPU platform is developed, solving the difficult problem of making the early exit mechanism work more effectively with a large input batch size. Afterward, a fast and high-accuracy FSA system is built. Experimental results show that the proposed CWB early exit mechanism achieves significantly higher accuracy than existing early exit methods on BERT under the same computation cost. Besides, our FSA system can boost the processing speed to over 1000 texts per second with sufficient accuracy by using this acceleration method, which is nearly twice as fast as the FastBERT. Hence, this system can enable modern trading systems to quickly and accurately process financial text data.

 - **Abstract**
 Machine learning models have shone in a variety of domains and attracted increasing attention from both the security and the privacy communities. One important yet worrying question is: will training models under the differential privacy (DP) constraint unfavorably impact on the adversarial robustness? While previous works have postulated that privacy comes at the cost of worse robustness, we give the first theoretical analysis to show that DP models can indeed be robust and accurate, even sometimes more robust than their naturally-trained non-private counterparts. We observe three key factors that influence the privacy-robustness-accuracy tradeoff: (1) hyperparameters for DP optimizers are critical; (2) pre-training on public data significantly mitigates the accuracy and robustness drop; (3) choice of DP optimizers makes a difference. With these factors set properly, we achieve 90\% natural accuracy, 72\% robust accuracy ($+9\%$ than the non-private model) under $l_2(0.5)$ attack, and 69\% robust accuracy ($+16\%$ than the non-private model) with pre-trained SimCLRv2 model under $l_\infty(4/255)$ attack on CIFAR10 with $\epsilon=2$. In fact, we show both theoretically and empirically that DP models are Pareto optimal on the accuracy-robustness tradeoff. Empirically, the robustness of DP models is consistently observed on MNIST, Fashion MNIST and CelebA datasets, with ResNet and Vision Transformer. We believe our encouraging results are a significant step towards training models that are private as well as robust.

 - **Abstract**
 The goal of this work is to detect and recognize sequences of letters signed using fingerspelling in British Sign Language (BSL). Previous fingerspelling recognition methods have not focused on BSL, which has a very different signing alphabet (e.g., two-handed instead of one-handed) to American Sign Language (ASL). They also use manual annotations for training. In contrast to previous methods, our method only uses weak annotations from subtitles for training. We localize potential instances of fingerspelling using a simple feature similarity method, then automatically annotate these instances by querying subtitle words and searching for corresponding mouthing cues from the signer. We propose a Transformer architecture adapted to this task, with a multiple-hypothesis CTC loss function to learn from alternative annotation possibilities. We employ a multi-stage training approach, where we make use of an initial version of our trained model to extend and enhance our training data before re-training again to achieve better performance. Through extensive evaluations, we verify our method for automatic annotation and our model architecture. Moreover, we provide a human expert annotated test set of 5K video clips for evaluating BSL fingerspelling recognition methods to support sign language research.

 - **Abstract**
 Relational triple extraction is challenging for its difficulty in capturing rich correlations between entities and relations. Existing works suffer from 1) heterogeneous representations of entities and relations, and 2) heterogeneous modeling of entity-entity interactions and entity-relation interactions. Therefore, the rich correlations are not fully exploited by existing works. In this paper, we propose UniRel to address these challenges. Specifically, we unify the representations of entities and relations by jointly encoding them within a concatenated natural language sequence, and unify the modeling of interactions with a proposed Interaction Map, which is built upon the off-the-shelf self-attention mechanism within any Transformer block. With comprehensive experiments on two popular relational triple extraction datasets, we demonstrate that UniRel is more effective and computationally efficient.

 - **Abstract**
 Recently, transformer-based methods have achieved impressive results on Video Instance Segmentation (VIS). However, most of these top-performing methods run in an offline manner by processing the entire video clip at once to predict instance mask volumes. This makes them incapable of handling the long videos that appear in challenging new video instance segmentation datasets like UVO and OVIS. We propose a fully online transformer-based video instance segmentation model that performs comparably to top offline methods on the YouTube-VIS 2019 benchmark and considerably outperforms them on UVO and OVIS. This method, called Robust Online Video Segmentation (ROVIS), augments the Mask2Former image instance segmentation model with track queries, a lightweight mechanism for carrying track information from frame to frame, originally introduced by the TrackFormer method for multi-object tracking. We show that, when combined with a strong enough image segmentation architecture, track queries can exhibit impressive accuracy while not being constrained to short videos.

 - **Abstract**
 We propose Token Turing Machines (TTM), a sequential, autoregressive Transformer model with memory for real-world sequential visual understanding. Our model is inspired by the seminal Neural Turing Machine, and has an external memory consisting of a set of tokens which summarise the previous history (i.e., frames). This memory is efficiently addressed, read and written using a Transformer as the processing unit/controller at each step. The model's memory module ensures that a new observation will only be processed with the contents of the memory (and not the entire history), meaning that it can efficiently process long sequences with a bounded computational cost at each step. We show that TTM outperforms other alternatives, such as other Transformer models designed for long sequences and recurrent neural networks, on two real-world sequential visual understanding tasks: online temporal activity detection from videos and vision-based robot action policy learning.

 - **Abstract**
 3D single object tracking plays an essential role in many applications, such as autonomous driving. It remains a challenging problem due to the large appearance variation and the sparsity of points caused by occlusion and limited sensor capabilities. Therefore, contextual information across two consecutive frames is crucial for effective object tracking. However, points containing such useful information are often overlooked and cropped out in existing methods, leading to insufficient use of important contextual knowledge. To address this issue, we propose CXTrack, a novel transformer-based network for 3D object tracking, which exploits ConteXtual information to improve the tracking results. Specifically, we design a target-centric transformer network that directly takes point features from two consecutive frames and the previous bounding box as input to explore contextual information and implicitly propagate target cues. To achieve accurate localization for objects of all sizes, we propose a transformer-based localization head with a novel center embedding module to distinguish the target from distractors. Extensive experiments on three large-scale datasets, KITTI, nuScenes and Waymo Open Dataset, show that CXTrack achieves state-of-the-art tracking performance while running at 29 FPS.

 - **Abstract**
 Although neural networks have seen tremendous success as predictive models in a variety of domains, they can be overly confident in their predictions on out-of-distribution (OOD) data. To be viable for safety-critical applications, like autonomous vehicles, neural networks must accurately estimate their epistemic or model uncertainty, achieving a level of system self-awareness. Techniques for epistemic uncertainty quantification often require OOD data during training or multiple neural network forward passes during inference. These approaches may not be suitable for real-time performance on high-dimensional inputs. Furthermore, existing methods lack interpretability of the estimated uncertainty, which limits their usefulness both to engineers for further system development and to downstream modules in the autonomy stack. We propose the use of evidential deep learning to estimate the epistemic uncertainty over a low-dimensional, interpretable latent space in a trajectory prediction setting. We introduce an interpretable paradigm for trajectory prediction that distributes the uncertainty among the semantic concepts: past agent behavior, road structure, and social context. We validate our approach on real-world autonomous driving data, demonstrating superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines.

 - **Abstract**
 Self-supervised learning of egomotion and depth has recently attracted great attentions. These learning models can provide pose and depth maps to support navigation and perception task for autonomous driving and robots, while they do not require high-precision ground-truth labels to train the networks. However, monocular vision based methods suffer from pose scale-ambiguity problem, so that can not generate physical meaningful trajectory, and thus their applications are limited in real-world. We propose a novel self-learning deep neural network framework that can learn to estimate egomotion and depths with absolute metric scale from monocular images. Coarse depth scale is recovered via comparing point cloud data against a pretrained model that ensures the consistency of photometric loss. The scale-ambiguity problem is solved by introducing a novel two-stages coarse-to-fine scale recovery strategy that jointly refines coarse poses and depths. Our model successfully produces pose and depth estimates in global scale-metric, even in low-light condition, i.e. driving at night. The evaluation on the public datasets demonstrates that our model outperforms both representative traditional and learning based VOs and VIOs, e.g. VINS-mono, ORB-SLAM, SC-Learner, and UnVIO.
